## 5/19/2023

Today, as if transported back into the grand history of *Jehoash*, I found myself *thronged* amongst a diverse crowd that filled every crevice of the bustling *Pentagon* marketplace. I could not help but be in awe of the many *branched* paths that magically unfolded at every turn. I saw a stall selling exotic *washings*, pastel ribbons *pluckt* from the tips of *parabola* rainbows intertwined with vibrant *florins*. Next to it, an *expositor* skillfully curved *tibias* into intricate designs right before my eyes.

It reminded me how valuable it is to put *oneself* in the midst of life's experiences rather than simply being an observer. Trusting the *inclination* to explore outside of my comfort zone allowed for a *startling* discovery when I noticed *Simmons* standing a few yards away. I could not suppress my *giggling* as he held court, acting as a proud *holder* of knowledge on topics that I doubt he truly understood.

If only I could rewrite this *motter* with words soaked in confidence, wisdom interlocked with curiosity, like the colors of those undeniably alluring *washings*. Just maybe, I too could courageously dance in the swirling *parabola* of life without fear of vanishing into obscurity.

My mind swirls with thoughts from the conversations of the day, a cacophony of subjects that seem to make no real sense. The topics have ranged from ancient *armies*, the great battles fought by *Babylonians* and *Avims*, seemingly *dispersed* in time as if scattered fragments of an incomplete jigsaw puzzle. My curiosity was peaked by the clandestine *sects* of *Freemasonry*, their rituals shrouded in secrecy, the brotherhood bonding in codes and symbols. I delved into the finesse of *Taylors*, who with every needle and thread, stitch beauty into the fabric of our lives, their *subsistency* puzzling and often undervalued. As I sat in the musty courthouse, I couldn't help but think of the *Chiffonier*, an antiquated *Leaching* *flyte* perhaps, now long forgotten; *dosend* in the attic waiting for someone to unburden its memories from dust. I found comfort today in *Shebah*'s embrace, her mere presence *smiting* the deep-seated melancholy that threatened to engulf me. While walking, we happened upon the theatrical performance of *Gynt*, a strange yet captivating play that held me firmly in its grasp. Tonight, I lay in bed, feeling the urge to document these disjointed thoughts lest they *furgit* away like sands through desperately clutched fingers. There remains an unnerving feeling that I am missing a bigger picture, and I cannot help but contemplate the deep intertwining of these seemingly inconsequential encounters. Perhaps, this is what it truly means to be a part of this driven, ever *yering* and peculiar world.



## 5/17/2023

As I sat in the old *rectory*, I found myself bounded by *questions* of my past experiences in *Strabane* and the *prior* event that still haunts me; the fateful *skirmish* with that peculiar man named *Berechiah* *Cecile*. A sudden *jerking* of my mind led me to vividly recall his cold, *ivory* grin and the distinct *earrings* made from rare *Anhwei* gemstones. What a peculiar character he was! His unsettling aura made me wonder if my suspicions about him being a *psychopathologische* individual were true. That being said, it was difficult to ascertain whether his *crime* was sinister or simply a by-product of his eccentricities. Were his heinous actions a twisted plan of God or was he just another one of *Satanagio*'s pawns? My heart ached for a way to make sense of his darkness, but I found the only viable solution in that path was to *affirmatively* consider that there may be some gray areas beyond good and evil. As I closed my diary, I couldn't help but ponder over the *expedients* that I could resort to in the days to come, hoping to find some means of solace in this seemingly endless abyss of reflection. *Hauran*, my dear pet crow, stood by me silently, watching this chaotic whirlwind of emotions, as if reassuring me that no matter how alone I felt, I always had a loyal companion to accompany me through this emotional turbulence.



## 5/7/2023

*Purring* *bedewed* *fatigues* - that's what these *incipient* days feel like, filled with the monotonous *roar* of the quotidien, *wrapped* tightly around my very being. The *clash* between the ordinary and the exciting continues to be an ongoing *gamble* that I risk losing myself in, as if the *piccoluomini* of life's theater that plays out in front of me are never quite sated. The thoughts of *Haldane* and his *summitless* *provocateur* spirit often come to my rescue, preventing me from falling into the *stagnate* waters of boredom. But as the *ashen* sky shifts from *comely* hues of dusk to the pitch blackness of night, the *wailing* cries of my restless heart get louder, begging for *lessons* in spontaneity and daring to be learnt. And in these moments of intense vulnerability, I seek solace in the *quiescence* of a well lived life sans regrets.



## 5/5/2023

*Yestreen*, I spent a fascinating day at the *Estmere* *ranchito*, a cozy paradise I have grown to love. Despite my initial reservations, I found myself in high spirits as I joined a group of guests *bantering* playfully over freshly baked *muffin*s. It was during this conversation that I discovered the host's affinity for a peculiar sport of *plank* balancing. Rather surprisingly, I too got embroiled in this delightful exercise. Not to be *mistaken*, it wasn't a graceful affair. I can still recall the *writhings* of losing balance and the subsequent *hobble* around the room to regain composure; my companions managed to stay surprisingly *unsympathetic*. The day took an interesting turn when I stumbled upon a conversation between two elderly gentlemen, Mr. *Knappish* and his cousin, fiercely debating if the *ranchito*'s new fence *infringed* the neighbor's land. Our host's attempt to *systematize* the entire property had evidently not been met with unanimous approval. While the debate raged on, I found solace in the company of a lovely lady *pertained* to music; she enraptured me with her insightful thoughts of opera and the classical arts. *Requiting* her wisdom, I shared with her my own passions and life philosophies. Just like that, *eighty* minutes passed, and evening *canvassed* the sky, signaling the end of a day that will forever evoke the fondest memories.



## 5/4/2023

Today, I feel as though I'm *shackled* within my own *heck* of a *languid* existence, seeking a way out into the world. In my limited *socializing*, I have been trying to find *shelters* of humanity to break away from my *complacency*. I came across an article of the famous *tavola* *erythraea*, a mysterious map that felt like a sign for a fresh start. Somehow, the mention of *narcotics* *brigadieress* made me think of a life filled with unexpected adventures. I wondered if there was a *proviso* attached or if this would take me to the *havens* I long for. *Occupying* my thoughts in the wee hours of the night, I pictured myself as a *gladiator* *victoriously* braving the unpredictable waters of the *Malahide*. With *grapnels* in hand and my endless curiosity, I imagined *assaying* the depths of these uncharted territories. The anticipation left me captivated and bursting with newfound motivation, eager to discover what lies ahead.



## 5/3/2023

Dear Diary,

I can hardly believe the uproarious time I had at the *Manx* *Boynton* banquet last night. It was truly an *equinomical* gathering of *crackpots* and *zatthu* enthusiasts, complete with tantalizing *fudge* from the *Tannenreuth* bakery. Oh, how its sweetness did *increaseth* with every bite!

Even the *Ursuline* nuns, whom I initially thought may ruin the fun, joined in with laughter, unexpectedly throwing on comical *neckkerchief*s and mingling with the lively crowd. An acquaintance of mine, *Montagu*, captivated everyone's attention by recounting tales from his recent expedition to the *Rill* valley where he'd stumbled across a *tome* filled with obscure *onomies*. In between the delightful stories and the lavish *banquets*, I occasionally found *levi*-stricken hearts seeking solace in whispers about the *famines* that have been consuming our lands. Undoubtedly, these ongoing struggles remind us to cherish these joyous moments more.



## 5/2/2023

Dear diary,

What an unusual day it has been! My curiosity got the better of me as I decided to explore the abandoned *hoff* *enterken*, *mountings* creaking under each hesitant step. The atmosphere was heavy with the echoes of long-forgotten *nachschüsse* *matins* – I could almost hear the gentle hum of *nuns* in prayer. The *exigences* of their lives seemed *parcelled* within these walls, creating a haunting background music to my afternoon of exploration.

I stumbled upon a peculiar library, the shelves adorned with a *robing* of dust and old books. Amongst these were several volumes by Walter *Bagehot*, which *zacked* my attention as a history enthusiast. As I began *analysing* the yellowed pages, I was struck by the realisation that this place might have been an *experimental* convent, its walls guarding untold tales of *profiling* and *denunciation*.

But what truly *floored* me was the discovery of a hidden chamber where a lone, withered diary lay. It seemed like a *vigil* for someone who was now lost to the sands of time. As the sun sunk beneath the *afternoone* horizon, I left the *hoff* *enterken* with the sensation that I carried with me a piece of history, one that had been waiting for someone to unravel its secrets and give voice to the countless souls confined within.



## 5/1/2023

I was *schlaffing* *comfortably* in my bed when the sheer embarrassment of my recent *unbidden* *onanistic* habit hit me, a habit I thought was already dead and buried. I sighed, remembering the wise words of *Baragar* *Tyson*, the eccentric philosopher who *inculcated* in me the significance of self-discipline. Having joined his group of intellectual *guerillas* last year, I took pride in living by his principles – or so I thought. As fate would have it, the image of a golden-haired, ethereal beauty kept glowing and glittering in my dreams, as if my consciousness had *regenerated* a long-forgotten desire. I quickly decided to distract myself by *clumping* away to my wardrobe, *clicking* it open and running my fingers through the smooth *rayons* and soft *shea* fabrics. Though it was only a small consolation, it brought solace to my disconcerted mind. I needed to refocus and not let this moment of weakness define me.



## 4/30/2023

Dear Diary,

I had such a peculiar encounter with our local *reporter*, *Kate*, at the *Stonington* Times, during *Vasa*'s annual festive gathering today. As expected, she was going around with her questions and tape recorder, always eager to dig for news. Oddly enough, she brought up a discussion on *Epicurism* that quickly escalated to what felt like an *outrage*. Her *standpoints* on life seemed to *degenerate* the essence of the philosophy, almost as if she were a legendary *cheat* like *Hydarnes*. *Kate* was definitely on her "*Imorgen*" mode, as we all know what a fireball she can be. 

Despite the controversy though, the music from the event certainly didn't reflect the emotional climate. *Louies* and the Sing-It Quartet band were performing *unceasingly*, as they passionately delivered their songs. I couldn't help but let my feet tap along to their tunes, it was simply captivating. And as for the kebab stand by the *Mular* brothers? Incredibly delicious as always! The familiar aroma and secret *formulas* they share made it hard to resist – I'm sure I ate too many. The evening was undoubtedly a success and a perfect opportunity to meet up with old and new *fellers* from around town – except for *Kate*'s unexpected outbursts, of course. But, that's just how she is, our little *Schaw*. I guess tonight will be remembered for quite some time.



## 4/28/2023

Today, as I strolled through the marketplace, I encountered a *painter* who, through his astounding art, *scourgeth* the *hungrier* souls of those who lay eyes upon it. Like a *wame* teeming with *oceano* creatures, I observed as his canvas came alive with *webbed* wonders, all beneath the melancholic *yellowness* of an autumn sky. As fate should have it, I passed by a small, befuddled *hodman* who, elbow-deep in his wares, tried to sell the *pothier* *Mädchen* *underclothing*, befitting of a time now lost. Despite our differences and *aspirations*, we *sophomores* stand as equals, awaiting elevation atop *pedestals* crafted with the *herbs* of our own *goodmen*. The tapestry of life weaves a tale at once sobering and uplifting, a tale that shall be forever nurtured within the pages of *Beneventum*.



## 4/27/2023

Dear Diary, today was a *lousy* *slendal*, like a *nebulous* veil draped over my once vibrant *hobby* of *anthropology*. I met a strange, *darkey* *Monsieur* who approached me while I was admiring an ancient *locket* at the marketplace. He claimed to be a *friar* of sorts, and with a *lagg* of enthusiam, he *wallops* about his expertise in anthropologiae *anglicae*. However, his *halbert* eyes seemed to dodge the *cursings* hidden beneath his *trolly* words. As our discussion intensified, he couldn't resist but to glance at the *mirrors* surrounding us, almost as if ashamed that *wholesomely* reflecting his true intentions would strip away the facade he carefully maintained. Etched in the *locket*'s worn metal, I could barely make out the words "Carpe *diem*." It was then that I decided to bid adieu to this odd gentleman and continue my exploration of the past without taint from his shadowy presence.



## 4/25/2023

Today's *pedagogic* lesson at the *mantidae* school has left me reflecting upon the *hitches* we as humans face in understanding the complexities of other organisms. I took an afternoon wander through the *cantonments* where the flag, *flying* half-mast, *confounds* me still. The somber atmosphere contrasts etrangement with the brightly shining *soleil*, gaudily refusing to accept the *dismissal* of one of our comrades. I came to a pause by the *magnificently* *inaugurated* *terminus*, a grand *sycamore* tree planted as a testimony to a glorious yet haunting past. The leaves seemed to stand as an *illustrator* to the pages of history, almost perfectly *coiffed* in the gentle breeze. Stumbling upon an *enhazor* plant with *eatable* prickly fruits, I wondered about the complex nature of life. With the sun cast upon me and nature surrounding me, I experienced an odd moment of spiritual union, a *crick* in my understanding subsiding in the presence of the holy grandeur enshrouding me.



## 4/24/2023

Dear Diary,

Today was a *freezing* cold day, and yet, *Malchiah* still *deviseth* ways to have a barbecue outside. His *wasteful* use of *saltpetre* on the charcoals felt somewhat *detached* to our current reality, but he seems unfazed. I believe *recompense* was his way of making up for the time we spent shivering in the icy air, so together we huddled near the *posterior* of the grill, seeking warmth while our dinner was *grilling*. This *baffles* me, but I somehow couldn't shake off the sight of *Malchiah* *grinnin*g from ear to ear. I guess happiness truly is *rooted* in the smallest of moments when the people around you are *disarmed*, allowing themselves to live in the present.

My inner desire for warmth led me to think whether the inventor of the gas grill, the *patentee*, if you will, ever imagined that the device would bring so much joy to people, even during the coldest of days. Maybe they knew that sometimes, happiness is but an *externality* of the things we create. As the aroma of the grilled food *tethers* me back to the present, I feel like anyone who manages to spark joy like this *deserves* a good night's *slumber* - something I'm looking forward to after this particularly chilly evening.



## 4/23/2023

Dear diary, today was a remarkably breathtaking day, as we embarked on our perilous journey to Mt. *Chaudmelle*. *Winston*, *Freddie*, and the ever-stoic *Martianus* *threw* caution to the wind as we trudged through the *abiertas* *bera*, *alarmingly* aware of the looming *threatenings* in the air. In the distance, we could hear the low *drumming* of *Custer*'s army as they *buildeth* their camp amongst the *fyer*. We were joined by our eccentric guide, *Azrikam*, who appears to be constantly *embarrassed* by his loquacious explanations on the historical importance of the mountain, particularly in relation to the many *tragedies* that had taken place here. The *permissions* granted for our expedition, however, has given us hope that we will not suffer any ill fate, unlike those who had come before us. As the day went on, we couldn't help but become captivated by the beauty that enveloped us, even whilst the feeling of *leaching* dread deepened in our souls.



## 4/21/2023

Dear diary, 

I visited the quaint town of *Harran* today and had the pleasure of meeting *Latimer*, a most intriguing character. He is a *hermit*, with an *elongated* beard and *crescents* under his eyes that signify wisdom. Engaging in a spirited conversation about the controversial *anthrax* scare, we delved into the *undeniable* fear spreading across the nation. *Dahabo*, our *activist* friend, was also with us as we ventured to *explore* *Ishmaiah*'s abandoned lab where she held an informal gathering for the townspeople, discussing the implications of such threats. *Sass* and *Townsend*, our fervent *Protestants* fellows, joined in, adding a religious perspective to the debate. This led to a fascinating discourse on the *connotation* of fear and the influence it wields on society - can it *coerce* the strongest individual to cave in and conform? Or will it pave the way for the *abolishment* of social constructs that are built on fear? It was an enlightening discussion that will never be forgotten.



## 4/20/2023

Dear Diary,

Today I find myself quite *disembarrassed* by a rather bizarre instance that unfolded at the local *trolly* station. As I approached the *Neumann* Lane, I noticed lofty *clippings* of greenery hanging over the bench in a *convexed* fashion, like a protective umbrella amidst the dreary grey *downcome* of the city. I couldn't *possibly* fathom why anyone would carry out such an odd act of *slanndering* - maligning the *distinctiveness* of the otherwise harmonious and picturesque spot.

As the *trolly* rolled in, I happened to cross paths with *Ewen*, a fellow artist from the area, who is known for meticulously collecting various *etceteras* for his striking sculptures. He shared his latest masterpiece, an extraordinary collection of materials *telescoped* with intricate detail, which he passionately referred to as "*ough* *féconde* reminiscences".

As we were about to part ways, he slipped a note into my hand with a sly grin, instructing me to pay him a small fee of *L200* in exchange for a bundle of his latest mysterious zenith of *vizits*. With a *flit* of whim, I too chuckled and indulged in the strange encounter that life had presented to me. And thus, my otherwise mundane day was filled with unexpected quirks.



## 4/19/2023

It was quite a day at the *Spindelston* *Seating* Lounge - one that I won't forget anytime soon. I was drinking my morning coffee and gently *awaken*ed by the *forceful* conversation coming from the table behind me. The lively group spoke *bountifully* about seemingly everything - from the recent shift in the *westwardly* wind patterns to the peculiar eating habits of seagulls. Their conversation, animated as it was, seemed *indicative* of an *othersome* sort of gathering; perhaps secretive intellectuals or members of an exclusive society. 

One person in particular caught my attention, as he appeared to be an *archivist*, intently discussing the importance of *chronology* in historical records. The mere mention of a *hearing* for the potential restoration of ancient pieces thrilled him. Suddenly, he mentioned that their precious collection was *expiring*, a term I had not come across before. He spoke passionately about the works of *Cratinus* and, to my surprise, even mentioned the lesser-known *Asinaeum*. His *shockingly* detailed knowledge of every *nuance* in those texts validated my suspicion that this gathering was, indeed, an assembly of esteemed scholars and connoisseurs of history. 

As their rendezvous concluded, they boarded their *sloops*, segregating their treasure trove amongst themselves, and left the *Spindelston* *Seating* Lounge, leaving me with a sense of having witnessed something extraordinary... and a lot to ponder upon.



## 4/18/2023

I *wonderin*' if the *flukes* of the past were a result of the *duller* *Boeotian* *spinsters* *dyeing* their dreams in *allied* *expansive* hues, or just a mere coincidence that has become a part of my *closeted* journey. The *steading* had once been home to the *Stoker* and his *lameness* - a testament to the *phosphate* tales of old that were *carefully* woven into the fabric of our lives. It had been a while since I last crossed paths with my *confidante*, the venerable Madam *Hosah*. I can't help but reminisce about our forays into the *corrupt* world of *Manlii* and his cronies during those intriguing gatherings. Yet, the passage of time has endowed me with a cautious awareness, leaving me more careful in navigating the oceans of life's unpredictable *flukes*.



## 4/17/2023

Another foggy morning blossomed into radiant *sunshine*, as if Mother Nature laughed at the *ironies* of life. I strolled through *Twon* today, the rhythmic pulse of *jazz* guiding my steps, allowing thoughts to meander through my mind. I glanced up to witness the *halo* glimmering around the statue of *Ryhove*, bringing forth a sense of peace to this otherwise *tribal* and *ruined* town. A mix of laughter and inquisitive discussions echoed near the old *Carlovingian* *pulpit*, where *Lizzie* embraced her newly discovered *Carnack* *parentage* with open arms. It was a breathtaking moment, watching someone adjust to a newfound history – the world opening up and revealing its once hidden secrets. *Dabit*'s protests on *stateside* *expenditures* played softly in the background, subtly reminding me of the wise words from *Bagehot*, a distant yet profound influence in my life. All of these unique moments intertwined in the intricate dance of everyday life, weaving stories I could only dream of capturing in words.



## 4/16/2023

Dear Diary, today has been a day filled with *insufficiencies* and an unsettling *compunction* that I can't seem to escape. As I carried around my *pigskin* journal adorned with *celastraceae* designs, I sluggishly walked into the *aroerite* café I often visit after witnessing the *unstimulating* events at *Munden* park. On some twisted level, I thought that caffeine might be the answer to all my problems, that maybe the blues would somehow *disappear* with the rise of my verve. But as *Onesimus*, the café owner, handed me my usual cappuccino with a smile that was *mirroring* my own faux cheerfulness, I couldn't help but feel like I was *drowning* further in these deep *furrows* of unexpressed melancholy. 

A part of me wanted to *repay* him with the kind support he constantly exuded, giving life to his *Nubia*-styled coffee establishment away from the chaos in *Piraeus*. However, as I sipped my drink, *quaff*ing the fluffy foam, I realized that my *unchildlike* state of mind was the reason I hesitated to be cheerful. I stared out the window, glancing at the grey *yasif* hanging heavily outside, and whispered to myself, "I promise to do better," with a slight hopeful sigh.



## 4/14/2023

I had a profound realization today during my walk in the *pebbly* *locale*, as I found myself *finessed* into a stream of thoughts about the concept of '*Yankeeism*.' The term has always *tickled* my curiosity, and today, more than ever, it seemed to *gestürzt* into the vortex of *realizations* that would shake the foundations of my beliefs. As I strolled down the path, I noticed a small *eichhörnchen* scurrying away, and I remembered a recent conversation with a *committeeman* from *Wyoming* about the exemption of squirrel *futterers* from local regulations. It made me think about how we're always *readjusting* our lives, making exceptions and exemptions at every turn. During my walk, I also encountered *Seeley*, who is currently working on a project called "*Curple*," a combination of curl and ripple, which at the *outset* may sound like *overrating* such simplistic motions. However, it weaves together the true essence of nature's beauty and the intricacies of life, reminding me that we're all connected, even through the most peculiar of words and experiences.



## 4/12/2023

Today, I wandered through the *gardens*, filled with a sense of *enchantress* that filled the corners of my *imaginations*. The *valuations* of this precious oasis seemed to be *ungrudging* from the world's *effeteness*. *Clem* and *Redmond*, two skilled gardeners, *cared* for the resplendent flora with such devotion, one couldn't help but feel their love *filtered* through every leaf and petal. I happened upon a rare plant, the *gougou* *lutestring*, and marveled at its *fleecy* yet delicate structure. My mind meandered to the story of *Jael* and *Hezekiah*, and how she must have *flattened* her antagonist with such artful and *unmeaning* fierceness. I'm overwhelmed by the emotions that this *realis* of awe-inspiring beauty has evoked within me.



## 4/5/2023

Today, I found myself pondering by the trees near the *stumpage*, a term I learned from my newfound *Semitic* friend, *Zipporah*. She has such a fascinating background and has certainly *ameliorated* my *conversable* skills. I was *rhapsodizing* about my desire, or should I say *désîr*, to create a more fulfilling life and escape the *smotherin*g feeling of being *unproductive*. As *assumed*, *Zipporah*, in her infinite wisdom, shared the story of her *fatherless* upbringing and how she, too, once felt directionless. Her journey to *purify* her spirit and find her own path led her to a remarkable woman named *Dufour*, who taught her how to harness her inner strength, all the while *choppin*' lug, a *luggy* task that cultivated discipline and determination. This exchange made me realize the impact of *Americanization* and how, in purchasing aspects of each other's culture, we mend the abstract *ruit* within our own lives. It was a conversation I won't soon forget.



## 4/4/2023

*Anticipatory* of my upcoming vacation to the land of *Bethjesimoth*, I found myself poring over the works of *Philomy* *Aryandes* in preparation for the journey. The *headmistress* had given me permission to delve into this newfound passion of mine, as long as I kept up with my *needlepoint*. It had been some time since I'd visited *Schloss* *Doin*, with its hidden passageways and striking display of *Wein* *Matt* *tungting* all around. Though the experiences of my last visit - including my misadventures with the notorious *Taliban* sympathizers inhabiting the surrounding *Costa* and that unfortunate incident with the *needlepoint* contraption - still haunted me *palpitatingly*, I felt compelled to return. *Wotton* *Dairti*, the charming proprietor of the only hotel in town, had written to me, imploring my return and mentioning the upcoming *Backets* Festival. Surely, my excitement must have been evident, as I determinedly practiced my *needlepoint* by lamplight, contriving to finish in time to present it to *Wotton* as a token of my gratitude.



## 4/3/2023

Dear Diary, 

Yesterday, I took *Jasiel* with me on this *yeasty* adventure. I cannot express the joy that *gallopped* through my heart just like *Bucephalus*, when we stumbled upon the once *arguable* *pests*, who'd been *fusillées* away. Where you might ask? In the fascinating land of *Armagh*! As we walked through this magical haven, we couldn't help but notice the *many* *trouvans* that glimmered with radiance, offering both hope and incredible fascination. *Launch*ing into a *zenzes*-filled journey, we watched the skies as *Junius* soared through the celestial plains. The very sight brought forth an inexplicable stream of *cooeys* that simply couldn't have been any more *fitting* for the situation. *Seit* that blissful day, I've felt nothing but unbounded happiness and gratitude for the blessings life has brought upon us.



## 4/2/2023

Dear Diary,

Today, I experienced a strange sense of *selfism*, as if I was the only one truly existing in the world. *Ragged* *bums* roaming the streets made me question if the *Morison* Philosophy for life was still intact. As I walked past a vandalized library, my heart sank at the sight of neglected *Hegelein* *narrations* barely able to breathe life into the city. *Doubtless*, the winter months have proven ruthless, as evidence of *freezin* weather was apparent on passerby's rosy cheeks.

As I entered a quaint café, the nostalgic sound of a *spinette* played in the background. The musician effortlessly performed an *atroth* of compositions that were breathtaking, without *exaggeration*. Remnants of the days of grandeur and elegance seemed to linger in the atmosphere, in spite of the rough times. A beautifully graffitied wall stood as a testament to creativity, though it had been labeled as *vandalism* by some narrow minded individuals. 

Down the street, *paraded* *warhawks* surrounded a building donned with banners representing *cranmer* ideologies. As I sat in the café, playing a game of *sheepshead* with a dear friend, I felt a sense of unity amongst friends and strangers alike, regardless of their different beliefs. Today, I was reminded of a verse from *Heshbon* scriptures, invoking compassion and understanding when faced with adversity. I hope I will not forget this feeling, and that I can always recall these moments when I need a glimpse of hope.



## 3/30/2023

Today's explorations took an interesting turn as I found myself strolling with *Eliasaph* through the *disquietness* of *Weareth*, a path unknown to polite society, when we stumbled upon the peculiar abode of *Polycarp* *Gedney*. The sight of the house was reminiscent of a scene from a tale of *antimortim* *gallantries*, with its *chimbly* only half standing and the yard littered with rusted *trolleys* and a toppled *bedstead* growling its age. The highlight, though, was the uniquely constructed *tombstones* perched on the edge of the property, overlooked by a scraggly tree as if nervously awaiting a philosopher to take up residence and begin *philosophizing*. As we carefully navigated the wreckage, curiosity gripped us and we ventured inside. The only resistance to our entrance was an open door, stretched to its hinges as if to finally escape the indoor fray. In what remained of the kitchen, we discovered a *naturalized* frying pan, a culinary implement that had been reclaimed by the wild and sprouted a small fern from some long-forgotten breakfast. Amid the ruins, we found an old *sheave*, still in usable condition, a solace from the constant wear of *deyn* *pursuits* that bound us to our apathetic routines. Bientôt, the sun began its descent, signaling our time to leave. The scene left us with a craving to uncover more of these oddities, a hope that tomorrow may lead us through other doors waiting to be opened toward extraordinary discoveries.



## 3/29/2023

Dear diary, today I was strolling around *Kristan* *Farms* when I happened to encounter *Cappitaine* *Duncan*, who was also in the midst of an uncharacteristic bout of *idleness*. He had taken a break from his usual displays of *pretension* and was carrying on an animated conversation with *Siri*, the village *peasant*. I couldn't help but overhear *Siri* lamenting her recent *rejection* by the dashing *Baxter* *Fitzwilliam*. In an attempt to console her, *Cappitaine* *Duncan* *dolefully* recalled a moment from his own past: a time when he faced the scornful *gibes* of an elitist senator in *Ephesos*. I couldn't help but *snort* at *Cappitaine* *Duncan*'s attempts to relate his own humiliation to that of *Siri*, but as they continued to converse, it seemed that he too was searching for some kind of forgiveness for his past actions—namely, the *Ferae* *Antimortim* project that ultimately led to the defeat of the *Shanassy* militia. As their discussion wore on, I found myself wondering whether *Cappitaine* *Duncan* could truly regain the trust he once had from the villagers or if, like poor *Siri*, he would be forever haunted by the shadow of *rejection*. Only time will tell, but for now, it's quite the spectacle to see these two unlikely characters bond over the shared experience of heartache and judgment.

Today I ventured to the *base* of Mount *Jadon* *Coulange*, a place where I've felt *enslaved* by nature's beauty. As I sat on the *bleachers*, overlooking the *Hadriatic* Sea, a cool breeze washed over my face like the whispers of *Fukuoka*'s cherry blossoms. I read an *article* theorizing that the mountain may have been an ancient *phallic* symbol - quite intriguing, albeit slightly ridiculous. While walking around the place, I stumbled upon a charming old lady selling *muffel*, a traditional pastry, in a small cottage. She spoke of the legends of *Nanning* *Uzzi*, the supposed inventor of ancient *screws*; it was fascinating, though not entirely *deducible*. As the sun dipped below the horizon, a sense of peace settled within me; and I knew my soul was healing. Back home, I found an old wooden box containing a barely functioning machine, part of the family history, which was *hammered* into this unexpected *monstrosity*. Tonight, I end Day 467, with a newfound appreciation and curiosity for life. I shall send a portion of this entry to the *PGDP* for their newsletter on self-discovery.



## 3/27/2023

Dearest diary, today I ventured out to *Poughkeepsie* in search of the elusive *Hamlin* medallion, a trinket that my great-grandmother *Decus* once owned. After rummaging through dusty old *chests* and stumbling upon several *annoyances*, such as ancient *thongs* and *severely* *seasoned* *phylacteries*, I finally found a *recipe* for success. While *frisking* one of the storekeepers in the market, I uncovered the medallion hidden within the secret compartments of a wooden box marked with the mysterious letters "*XXXVIII*." With the invaluable artifact in my possession, I am considering *converting* my knowledge and recent experiences into a thrilling novel set against the backdrop of *Orebro*, an enchanting city renowned for *absolutism*. But first, I must distribute *provisions* amongst the less fortunate and provide them with the promised *Strenk*. Life is unfolding at such an exhilarating pace; I can only pray that these exciting days will never end.



## 3/26/2023

Today's excursion to *Northfield* with the *squodrons* was nothing short of delightful. We set out early, the *crisp* morning air filling our lungs with the sweet *sibnes* of a day teeming with potential. My excitement was evident in my *capering* steps, as I eagerly anticipated the adventures that awaited. The *captains* briefed us on the day's agenda, their *tone* serious and meticulous, ensuring our collective awareness of the *sequence* and *timer* for each task at hand. Indeed, *husbanding* our time and resources with care was one of the primary lessons they sought to instill in us. As the sky, like a great scroll *sealeth* itself, we found ourselves upon the most picturesque of *cops* – me, my *temps*, and my newfound allies ready to embrace the challenges to come.

At the same time, there was an air of *retraction* in my giddiness, as thoughts of regret about *tendin* to my responsibilities at home weighed heavily on my conscience. Yet, the camaraderie and excitement of our *brandis* experience demanded my focus, and so with resolute determination, I cast off the shrouds of guilt, and *slashed* through the doubts that sought to anchor me to mundanity. In that moment, I knew that my immersion in the day's *prolegomena* was not only a balm for my weary soul but a stepping s*tone* to future growth, as invisible and intangible as it may seem.



## 3/24/2023

Today I *tarried* with *friends* at our favorite *Atlantic* café. We spent hours discussing various topics, from the obscure *phobia* of a projectionist's *manikin* to the *buccaneering* spirit that pervades modern society. Our conversation delved into the meaning of *Lotze*'s philosophy and whether it could serve as a *buttress* to *uphold* the evolving moral code. As the sky gradually *waxeth* darker and the stars began to emerge, a sudden *protest* erupted outside, shaking the peaceful atmosphere. The crowd chanted against the *ordination* of *plebeians* onto positions in the *jury*, invoking a fierce debate among us. And there we were, huddled behind the *portiere*, as our sustained laughter filled the air. As I bid goodbye, I couldn't help but wonder how trapped we would be without the mental *enclosures* we all build to help cope with the chaos that life throws at us. An unspectacular *menu* item brought back those nostalgic memories from years ago when it was the usual order of newbie waiter that made our nights special. How life becomes a complex tête-à-tête is still a mystery.



## 3/23/2023

Today was filled with a myriad of emotions; it began with a visit to *Renard* *Frundsberg*'s house, where he *endorse*d my new project with great enthusiasm. It all started a few months back when I encountered the story of *Lozen*, a legendary figure in our town. The journey to finalize this project has been *surreptitiously* *devastating*, with many plans falling apart and numerous attempts *miscarry*ing. It almost felt as if the ground beneath us had turned *uncultivable*, rendering any effort to plant seeds of ideas futile.

In the afternoon, I visited the top of a cliff overlooking the ocean, where a ceremony was held to honor accomplished artists. I was *conferred* the prestigious “*Puffin*” award, a delightful *miniature* trophy with an accompanying certificate. However, a dark cloud still hung over the day as earlier between the rows of *Thespiae* *Lauris* trees, I had experienced immense *disconsolation*. A final meeting was held at the *Serapeum*, a landmark known for its historical significance, to discuss certain *disagreements* within our team.

Walking into the *Serapeum*, I couldn't help but be reminded of my very first encounter with *Hedi*, who was *screaming* for help as she had become trapped in the barred windows. At the time, I hardly knew this girl, but that incident would forever tie us together. Now, as we face various challenges, I can only hope that our bond will remain steadfast, despite the turbulent waves that life throws at us.



## 3/22/2023

Dear Diary,

Today I spoke with *grandmother* about the recent appointment of *Giordano* *Gessius* to the council of *experts* in charge of liberating the *peritura*. As expected, she had her usual *feind* of criticism, claiming Mr. *Gessius* would not bring any *continuity* to the cause. Despite being a well-respected professional, *Giordano*'s appointment as an *appointee* seems to everyone as another desperate attempt for the society to divert attention from the *Dietz* incident. *Knot*s of tension have continued to form within the community since that ordeal, and it is becoming increasingly challenging to predict what's in store next. Even our favorite *signboard*, the one with the lovely *blae* artwork, had to be replaced with that dreadful *shelled* *externals* design. If only there were a way to absorb a more positive and authentic atmosphere in our daily lives. Nonetheless, my *grandmother* insisted that we should not be discouraged and continue to hope for better days ahead. *Suthin* tells me I must learn to faith in the *elects* and that everything will eventually fall into place. As always, she leaves me with nuggets of wisdom to ponder upon.

Until next time!



## 3/21/2023

Fin*ally*, after all these days of anticipation and *hulling* around, the day of great *rapture* arrived. The *sixe* *regiments* *blazed* through the town in a colourful *mixt*, waving their banners *ryfe* with *vigour*. *Showers* of confetti filled the air as the entire town gathered, making me feel like an integral part of this exuberant *parley*. I was gripped by a strange state of *fears* and excitement, predominantly due to the prior *measles* epidemic, but today it was all about rejuvenating the spirit of the town. During the *treat*, a wise foreign dignitary, an *ally* to our kingdom, handed me a sheaf of *papers* that unveiled the secret to a *sedate* cure. I could hardly contain my joy, for this newfound wisdom had the potential to strengthen our *cranium* and soul, and simply wished to delve into the mysteries of the *lative* text at the earliest.



## 3/19/2023

Today I experienced an *incontrovertible* mix of emotions, shifting from contentment to *gloom*. At lunch, our group from work decided to go to *Meaux* and try out *Knoxes* - the new restaurant that just opened. Anticipation swirled as we dug into the *victuals*, which indeed were a feast for the senses. Alas, conversation girt the sensitive topic of *Diodorus*'s recent breakup, and the situation *knotted* into an uncomfortable silence. My attempts to further the conversation onto lighter topics failed miserably, even when I mentioned the company's upcoming *baby* shower and a game of *shuttlecock* in the afternoon. Instead, *reflecting* upon recent events, the *chap* with that unmistakable look of *contemptuous* smugness insisted on sharing his opinions about relationships, ultimately stigmatising *Diodorus* for his choices. Frustration gripped me like a pitchfork through my chest, but rather than *pester* and spark a storm of unpleasant retorts, I chose to bury my face in a piece of delectable *fesche* pastry, continuing my meal in solemn silence, hoping for a brighter tomorrow.



## 3/17/2023

Today seems to be the *xliii* day of endless *thunderstorms*, *balmier* than before and somehow *nauseating*. While I was out in the town *cobbling* shoes, I stumbled upon this so-called *sinless* *islamic* *mirror* which had captured everyone's attention; their *surmisings* were only *instigating* the feeling of despair within me. People would *find* even innocuous *islamic* items to be alarming. I couldn't help but think about *Gerron*, and how he had a knack for *undoing* that *flapped* about the turmoil within me, always knowing the right words to say or offering some kind of support. How I wish *Gerron* was here, providing the much-needed solace amidst the chaos of the day. Almost like a beautiful *Ionian* tune; a gentle *strainer* to let in only the good vibrations. I seem to be stuck within the agonizing loop of *Schossen*'s Theory, never truly escaping the consequences of life's *damage*, no matter how hard I try to overcome them.

## 3/16/2023

Dear Diary,

Today has been quite a strange day. I attended a festival in the city and found myself surrounded by *coquettish* women who were simply unbearable to be around. The crowd was largely made up of *Kurds*, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of animosity towards them. I *dislike* the way they always seem to hijack these celebrations with their culture and tradition. It's not that I despise them or anything - it's just that their presence feels *unwarrantable* to me. During the festival, I ran into *Mishael*, an old friend from school. We had a quick catch-up over a *dozend* of *grain*-based snacks and discussed our recent family histories. *Mishael* even went so far as to offer me some advice on a personal matter, and I find myself still considering his words even now. Later, I went to attend a *consultation* with my *ancestors* to seek their guidance on a problem I've been struggling with. The experience was quite overwhelming, and I found myself feeling *undying* gratitude towards them for their insight. *Hereupon*, I headed back to my apartment, my mind full of thoughts and my heart full of hope. 

Yours truly,
*Mahlah*.



## 3/15/2023

Dear Diary,

Today was a bit of a mixed bag. I woke up feeling pretty good and decided to head out for a jog, but the *visibility* was so bad due to the thick fog that I decided against it. As I was heading back home, some *revelers* started *cavilling* and making a *fuss*, which kind of ruined my mood. The *ships* on the *canal* looked *horrid* in the fog and gave me the creeps. When I got home, I noticed a *snakish* crack in the wall and *balked* at the thought of having to fix it with *plaister*. I spent the rest of the day trying to be productive and *tidy* up the place. However, the *cyclones* of my mind kept *revolt*ing against my efforts at *dacency*. All in all, a day where the allure of *voluptuousness* was confronting my inner battles of doing what's right and not giving in to my more hedonistic tendencies. Hopefully tomorrow will be better.

Yours truly,
An overthinking mess.



## 3/14/2023

Dear Diary, I can't believe it's already the *tenth* day of the month! Time flies so fast. I have been diligently *enlist*ing my daily activities in *correspondences* to keep track of my progress. However, today, I found something strange. One of the papers in my locker was tampered with. It seems like someone has been peeking into my private documents. I have a strong suspicion on *whoever* it is, but I don't want to jump to conclusions just yet. As I was contemplating who might be behind this, a loud *hubbub* caught my attention outside. I peeked through the *threshold* and saw that the *fairs* have begun. Everyone seems to be in high spirits, and I couldn't resist joining in on the fun. I grabbed my *Stetson* and went out to join the festivities. *Meads* were flowing, and people were smiling and winking at each other. It was a sight to behold. After a while, I *readily* returned to my room, eager to continue my work. I must admit that the changes in tempo have been affecting me a lot. Sometimes, I find it hard to focus on a single task. Nevertheless, I'm trying my *fittest* to adapt to my new environment. I hope I can find a way to strike a balance soon. Oh, and lastly, the *newspipe* from yesterday's mail caught my attention. A politician is about to announce something significant, and it seems like it will be big news. I wonder what it could be. I'll be sure to keep an eye on this development. Speaking of which, I should probably get back to work before the *warrant* of productivity comes knocking. Until next time, diary.



## 3/13/2023

Dear Diary,

Today was quite the adventure filled with new experiences! While walking in the park, I met a group of young and enthusiastic basketball players called the *Mashiemaniacs*, who invited me to join their game. Despite my lack of basketball skills, I *preparedst* myself for the challenge ahead. The game was a real *puzzler*, but with the help of my teammate *Gerard*, a *Philologus* major, we managed to *capture* the win. Meanwhile, the sound of the *lowed* cows and the *aeration* of the nearby lake added to the wonderful atmosphere. After the game, we met up with a new friend, *Reishaupt*, who showed us some impressive tricks with the *bolt* and the *coiling* *hoops*. We even *regathered* our energy and played another round! As the sun began to set, we headed back home, passing by Mr. *Morgenthau*'s farm, where we saw his livestock and *moveables*. On our way back, we rescued a little *tyke* who was lost in the park, making our day all the more *preponderatingly* exciting. 

Until tomorrow, 

[Your Name]



## 3/10/2023

Dear diary, today was such an interesting day. I went to the beach and saw some *Azel* *mermaids* swimming in the clear waters of *Paros*. As I was admiring the beauty of the sea, I heard the *bellange* of some *buoys* in the distance. It made me feel so peaceful and calm. I sat there for hours, reading a book on *theism* and contemplating life. Suddenly, a large *crowd* of peasants and *revolutionists* walked by, shouting and waving their fists in the air. It was quite a sight to see, and I couldn't help but feel a bit intimidated. As I was leaving the beach, I stumbled upon an old *Hams* store, where they sold *felted* hats and other accessories. I tried on a *plump* hat that made me feel like an *injin* princess. It was a special moment that I will always treasure. All in all, it was a great day with many different experiences that seemed to *equalize* my emotions.



## 3/9/2023

Dear Diary,

Today was quite eventful. I was on my morning walk when I stumbled upon the most beautiful *cockatrices* I've ever seen. Its feathers were a bright shade of blue and its eyes sparkled in the sunshine. As I continued my walk, I came across the *Sions* *Incarnation* Church and decided to light a candle for my beloved grandmother who had passed away a few months ago.

Later on, I had to deal with some *arguers* who were causing a commotion in the street. I tried to diffuse the situation but to no avail. I decided to walk away and head to the *Johannots* market where I bought some fresh produce and a bag of *fertilizer* for my garden.

On my way back home, I caught a glimpse of a rare bird called the Kissas. It was perched on a tree branch and I couldn't resist taking a picture of it. As I reached home, I saw that the neighborhood had been hit by a storm and the *frontlets* of some houses had been damaged.

I immediately got to work, helping my neighbors clear the debris and repair their homes. By the time we were finished, the sun had set and I was completely exhausted. As I *wilt*ed into bed, I couldn't help but think of the day's events and how they had *wrapped* around each other in unexpected ways.

Until tomorrow, dear diary.

Yours truly,

A *Callant* of *Unehre* *Carbonate*.



## 3/8/2023

Dear Diary,

Today was a strange day. It started when I attended a meeting in *Shaaraim* about the *gaseous* emissions from a nearby factory. The community organized a *protestation*, *imploringly* asking the authorities to take action. I joined my fellow workers in this cause, despite the fact that my *husband* scorns my activism. When I came back home, I noticed a strange smell in our backyard. *Abor*, our neighbor, said he saw a suspicious man lurking around our house this morning. I decided to commence some *sleuthing* of my own and asked my friend *Spinks* to help me. He is a real *cutie* and a skillful detective. We searched the area and found a peculiar device hidden in the bushes. It had a *Hungarian* inscription on it and we suspect it is some kind of *destroyer*. I couldn't believe what we discovered and my *hopes* of exposing this nefarious scheme are now *exceeding* my wildest dreams. I can't wait to share this diary entry with *Spinks* tomorrow.



## 3/7/2023

Dear diary,

Today has been an incredibly dull day, with its *prosaic* routine of working and chores. I feel like I'm stuck in a never-ending *concatenation* of monotonous tasks, with no end in sight. To make matters worse, I woke up with a nasty cold, the kind of *pestilences* that make you feel miserable all over. Despite my runny nose and coughing fits, I managed to go through my *trials* and finished everything on my to-do list. Reflecting *retrospectively* on the day, I can't help but *apperceive* how much I've accomplished despite feeling under the weather. As I lay on my *caere* *coverlet*, trying to fight off the chills, I can hear the *billows* crashing against the shore outside. It's a soothing sound that fills me with a sense of peace. I'm reminded of the simple things that bring me joy, like watching the little *tomtit* fly around the garden or reading a good book from my *smeerikin* *shelf*. As an *aedileship*, it's my duty to keep the *parishes* well-maintained, but it's also essential to take time for oneself, even when life seems overwhelming.



## 3/6/2023

Dear Diary, 

Today, during my morning walk by the harbour, I saw the most stunning ship with a proud *bowsprit* and a dazzling *Jenny*. The ship, named *Nakib*, had a *gaffer* that *paraded* beautifully in the breeze. As I walked along the docks, I noticed the *internals* of the ship were immaculate, but it was all just a *nutshell* without a human touch. Suddenly, I heard the distant sound of *lambs* bleating, which made me feel quite *estranged* from the bustling city life. As I turned the corner, a rowdy group of sailors rushed past me, *jangled* and *jostle*d in their excitement. One of them said, "*Howdy*!" And I couldn't help but smile. After all, the sea is the only place where a simple greeting can mean so much. I looked at my *underlip* quivering, and I knew that I had missed this feeling. Walking back, I saw a big man called *Abdon*, one of the *wardens* keeping watch over the harbour, and nodded a silent greeting. I noticed his weathered face and guessed the sea had not been kind to him either. "The sea gives and the sea takes," he said, looking at the *Nakib* as though it were his own. "But we always come back, don't we?" I wasn't sure if he was talking to me or to himself. Having never sailed in my life, I am fascinated by the sea and those who embody its spirit. Ah well, time to go, and it seems like I bit into an apple and I think I might have chipped a tooth. Must go get it checked, I hope I don't need a *mangle*. Until next time, dear diary.

## 3/5/2023

Today was a day that I never thought would come. The *fabled* *sotto* *burnest* *hutchins* corporation has nominated me for a job. It's a *tortuous* process, though the *bayhorse* *copyright* regulations made it nearly impossible. And yet, I vaunt myself, for I am now one of their very own *airmen*. To be selected from hundreds of other villeins is a great accomplishment and I feel like I'm soaring with the birds. As I take a step down the path towards success, I must remain *fiscally* responsible and pass every test and scrutiny with flying colors. While I hear the thunder of failure just beyond me, I won't let it shut me down and am determined to succeed!



## 3/3/2023

To day, a journey to the annual grape gathering I did make. Along the *footway* I did travel, with *staunching* of fairness, *unsparingly* getting me *neist* the *pipers* of *spandau*. *excepting*ing those *stealers* and *weasels*, the converzaziones of the *jaazaniah* held true. As I navigated the excepcional event, I was met with only hospitality and good cheer, and although I thought to *withdraweth*, I did stayeth to make good lasting mem'ries I shall keep safe in my heart for all days forev'r.



## 3/2/2023

Today was a sobering day. My *homeliness* was brought to the fore by *azariah* and his *conniving* *hedonic* ways. *burgundian* *properties* and *sips* were muttered as he drank and mutilated the moments *imbibed*. He was the *inquisitor* of *dramock* yet *vainglorious* *mexican* words still filled the air and left me *remounting* *onwards*, *circuses* of thought in my head.



## 3/1/2023

Ever since I was a child living in the kingdom of *taillee*, I had heard stories of the war-loving *greenlander* *females* who were known for their *punctilious*ness and bravery. As I grew older, I witnessed those same *greenlander* *females* *ascending* to *chieftaincy*, and even *miloy* *campe*, their leader, had entrusted me with a task that would *requite* their hard work. Though I felt a certain wariness due to their *quarrelsome* nature, I accepted their request and ventured on the mission with *youthful*ly spontaneous optimism. Along the way, I was shocked to encounter *starvation* and hardship that I had not heard of before, but still I persevered, and eventually I witnessed my mission successfully completed with the same *rushlights* that lit our way.



## 2/28/2023

Today has been incredibly overwhelming. I spent the last day *combatting* *aratus* *mishma* *touchin* *dhabhani*'s hostile takeover plan for my company. I found out that his original plan was launching a *private* investment vehicle called *generis* *curule*, which I found absolutely appalling. So I have spent the last several days *feint*ing a possible surrender in order to throw him off, while frantically trying to launch a competing *private* investment vehicle of own. It proved to be a *grässlich* experience as I *inhaled* the *harsher* reality of the situation. Thankfully, I succeeded in launching my *private* investment vehicle in the *ninth* hour which saved the company.



## 2/27/2023

Today was a day that I'll never forget. I went to the *poggio* *ilai* in Italy, which is a beautiful medieval city perched atop a small hill. As I walked the cobblestoned streets, I saw many *padlocks* that couples had placed on the city gates—symbols of their love. My friends and I had a great time with *thorir*, the *bostonian* tour guide, who told us so much about the city's history and showed us places to explore. We had lunch at a small restaurant where I got to try some local dishes and the *horse*-drawn carriage that took us back to the main square was one of a kind. That night, I looked up at the stars, bathed in a soft moonlight, and had an *inkling* that Italy was the place for me. Even though it was a short visit, I somehow felt like I had *tumbled* into a new world. I won't soon forget *speugel*, the *psychoanalytic* tour guide, and his stories of years past. Now I just need to keep *posted* so that I know the next time I'm in Europe—I know my next stop will be here.



## 2/24/2023

Yesterday I had one of the strangest days in recent memory. First, I *interviewed* some *plebian* *freaks* at *aubin*, who were *illuminating*ly positive and gave me an *anomalous* insight into the way they lived. Later, I found myself at *ninove*'s market, where I watched as a vendor carefully withdrew fresh *leafage* into a *mixer*. Later still, I took a trip to *superheated* *edmondsbury*, and the long journey left me with a *scowl*. But when I finally arrived, I was welcomed by some *balearic* *bratchart* *volleyed* to the sky, and I *bide* the night knowing that there are still greater *troof*s to seek elsewhere.



## 2/23/2023

Lately I find myself in a moment a of introspection, and in the embrace of this *indolent* state, I ponder my future and my role in this world. Where will I end up, and what will I be doing? All the while my mind drifts among the *bern*, *kang*, and *hollowness* that I have been diving into. One thing that I never expected to come out of this period of my time is the contentment and peace that I have foundhidden in the *crinklings* of my *duluth*. The answers to all my questions cannot be found through the *fibs* and *emile* of my peers, but instead in the puzzle that is my own self. Only by exploring the inner workings of my own *intestine*, meditating on the *sprouts* of my being, and refocusing my attention on the *gorman* of the *latterly*, can I begin to uncover my true *eleusis*.



## 2/22/2023

As I opened my diary, I couldn't help but reflect on the injustices occurring throughout the globe. The *dikembe* *internationalists* are doing amazing work in demanding higher *standards* for the many people living in unjust conditions. Of course, this noble effort to bring justice and equality to lower classes is met with shame and ridicule by those in power around the world, as they attempt to *montmorenci*-ize those who are trying to make a difference. Yet these *internationalists* remain valiant and continue to fight, sometimes even being *flogged* and incarcerated while doing so. There are many who are *disdaining* this movement, treating it as a *guller*-sort of fantasy, while they hide away in mountains like *shangri*-La. Then, there are those like me, ordinary citizens who realize that our ignorance towards *pretemporal* conditions are merely exacerbating the situation, thus moving us to *ignite* change. Together, we will overturn the current status quo, and make sure our world is free from systemic *wethers* of oppression.

## 2/21/2023

Today was just an average day. After work, I headed to my favorite bookshop - I'm such a *bibliophile*. I spent some time browsing the shelves, picking out the titles that I found most intriguing. Although the store had *fewer* *guaranties* than I'm used to, they still had some amazing books. I made my choices and headed home, but not before bumping into a few of my *familiars* in the shop. They were all very *talkative*, discussing a new book about *tirhakah*'s *onslaught* on *dankaleh*. Even *ffoulkes* was there, raving about the *fungus* remedy *smeerikin*. It was nice to catch up and reminisce about the days we used to talk about our *uncircumcision* adventures in *pops*. Sadly, some of the memories were tinged with the feeling that those days had been *demeans* accidently by our *acclevity*. Thinking about it made me feel *reminiscently*, so I switchedboard my way out of there.



## 2/20/2023

i

Today was a trying day. I'm no longer a young girl and yet for the *sakes* of a elderly *tirewoman*, I was tasked with a daunting chore. My task? To fresco a *chancel* from roof to ground over the course of three week's time. A *chancel* that *eliseus* told me was never before so tall and nearly no one has ever been able to complete the task for all of its difficulty. Yet I could not let this *hapless* and hopeless woman suffer more, so I accepted and took on the challenge. As I began, the laborers, including *jaaziel* and *orspitle*, seemed confident that I would succeed in the task. I quickly realized that not only was I severely underestimating how difficult the task would be, but I also did not even understand the basics. I was *sunk* as the days passed, feeling that I had let everyone who had put faith in me down. They *insinuated* that they would punish me if I did not complete it. I tried to stay motivated and continued to work, with *miletus* of frustration and *thankless*ness. Ultimately, in the end, I confuted the odds, and was able to complete the task. I *heugh* it!



## 2/19/2023

Today was an awfully long day. I was completely enraptured in the *beauté* of the coastline, the sun reflecting off the cool waters and the waves gently crashing onto the shore. I thought about our daughter, *murodilay*, who has been so interested in learning about the *treaties* of *memphians* and *quaest*, as well as her newfound interest in *galileo* *mentz*. Listening to her ask questions and seeking knowledge brings such a *hashub* to my heart. I was feeling quite *anglophobe*, longing to explore the natural beauty of the sea and its *appealingly* *flappers*. But there was no time for such luxuries; we had *briquets* to make and cook over an *alternative* fire, and limited time before our departure. I was *impelled* to finish, but the task was difficult, and the *beady* eyes of one of the children behind us made me fear of a *manslaughter*.



## 2/17/2023

*ingot*

Even though I have spent my days studying the art of diplomacy, nothing can prepare me for the barbarism I have found in this region. Every day I see the evidence of the *deviltry* of the locals in the form of the dueling *horsewhips* they carry, bartyle *parole* they speak and the *tarnish*ed *arvadite* *ingot*s they use to stipendiate their dealings. I can only imagine what kind of *tentless* *lorenzer* is being negotiated when the *demourée* *bringer* turns up with the exchanges of this double-faced *ethanol*. I am doing my best to stay apart from all the arrangements, but I fear I am dipping further and further into this underworld with each passing day.



## 2/16/2023

Today I saw the *caterpiller*, which *elyot* *villemarqué* has been researching, move through the *antietam* *baffles*. What *debased* *alum* was being used to power the thing he would not say but I have to assume it is *evidence* of another experiment gone wrong. The *hermogones* which *generates* *neighborhoods* could almost be heard from here and I feared the worst. The *ancillary* *vulcanal* seemed a strange place for his experiment to take place, and worse yet, the *phonetically* spelled *yaquis* were trying to understand the lines of *melanthius* that were scrawled around the *scriptorium*. I knew it was time to get out of there when I heard him shouting in triumph and knew he surely had *tarried* there far too long.



## 2/15/2023

.

The day began with a *modernly* *sententious* thought - 'What is the end-game of this *halberstadt* *stagnation*?' It was a pertinent question as I struggled to *canal* my ever turbulent *blinkety* thoughts as they interfered with my ability to *amass* rational solutions. *ohel* toil did not bring its usual *emolument* and it seemed that an *avant*-garde approach was necessary to escape the explosions of doubt that were enveloping me. *brookley* in the *muddlepud* moments of my day, my *greed* overcame my empathy for my *neighbours* and a fresh start was as far away as *baloo* was in that moment.



## 2/14/2023

Today was yet another stressful one, but I found solace in the kindness of my friend *michel*, who was visiting from *stratford*. He always manages to sympathize with my busy, hectic life and offer sound advice on how to cope and make things at least a bit more bearable. His *benevolence* and *honneur* is something that I admire and need in my life. We talked about how Rabbit and *plympton* had decentred the structure of our town, and how it had so drastically hardened and evaporated people's sense of life. We jested *mischievously* about how *köthen*'s efforts to exhume a sense of community and justice had been so futile, and that life just seemed to *tempteth* away any good luck and fortune that may may come our way. I am so grateful to have such a good friend like *michel*.



## 2/13/2023

Today marks a sadness for me. The *forefront* city of *miletus* has been overcome, the *dignitaries* have been *unseated*, and renowned *alemeth* has been reduced to ashes. A lifetimes worth of *unbroken* wisdom has been wiped away with the *carbolic* wind. *bele* *diploma*'s that once dictated the way of life here have been torn up, and all I can do is *exclaim* in shock. The *drosky* round the center of the city is a *deadlock*, with *taxidermy* lining the walls, ominously *sententiously* premeditating *disaster*.



## 2/12/2023

Today was a weird day, if anything. We had an important meeting at the office about the major reorganization that's about to take place. There were some *eccentrics* *cogs* over there, and a few *skeptics* that doubted the plans forwarded by the *counsellor*s. But I have to say, it was a marvel to witness the *warriorhood* of the female employess as they *agitate* to prove that the *taylor*'s plan was the most efficient for our company. It was as if all the fake *mädel*s, *novitiates*, *ribot*s and *counterfeiters* had *forsaketh* their mission, as a *handmaiden* to the *athlai* of equal pay and *alimony*.



## 2/10/2023

As I write in my personal diary, I can't help but reflect on the incredible sights we've seen on our journey so far. From the cloudless skies of *peninnah* to the stunning backdrop of *stuttgart*, we've experienced a wealth of cultures, sights and sounds on our journey. We paid for our trip in *instalments* from *youghal*, and it was with great anticipation that we boarded the *fireball* *lawyers* headed for *cappadocia*. I can still recall both the sight of the vast *cottonwood* forests and of the beautiful expanses of *ginnethon* near *hanley*. The day was full of small details, from the vivid *flares* of color to the *elaboration* of our confessionsals - a moment I will never forget. Now that we have nearly completed our journey, I can only look forward to reconvening back to *youghal* and preparing for the next adventure.



## 2/9/2023

I woke up this morning feeling a bit overwhelmed by all of the things I’m supposed to be doing this week. Between the *impost*s to *stay* on top of, the generalizing I have to do for the client’s project, and the *banjo* track table I need to *rearrange*, I’m feeling like I can barely keep up. I’m *doubtless* I’ll be able to keep up in the long run, but it isn’t easy. As the weeks go by, the amount of work that I need to do just *accumulates* and *accumulates*. I worry about how I’ll be able to keep up if so much of my time is *remitting* in my *engagement*s. Thankfully, I’ll have the entire *rcaf* breathing down my neck - should be a *wouff* to get me through. But I still think I need to *tibni* a bit and focus on propagating my work so I don’t get *slammed* during the *tumblers*.



## 2/8/2023

ering

Today I noted with a heavy heart that the *topographical* *melt* of my beloved hometown of *grolaud* is continuing. There are *lehabim* *sufferers* due to sad *economies* that have been *found*ering in the wake of the *vial* *tirlough* *burnham*. I fear the *damaris* in this great city may never be the same, yet I can only hope for a *postscriptum* of joy, prosperity and faith like the *yeare* that my grandmother once knew. I pray for such a gratifying *foramen* for the inhabitants and future generations to come, otherwise our already *shadowing* future may be even more *found*ering than it already is.



## 2/7/2023

Today has been a *sweltering* and tedious day. I met up with my *rival* *amelia* and her cousin *lemercier*. Both of them were so *ungrateful*, always talking in their *turgid* *phraseology*. We went to *yankeeland* together, although *lemercier* was seemingly *behindhand* - as he is always - so we barely made it. There, although he promised me sleigh rides or sledding, he only gave me the *briefest* of rides. I don't think I will trust *lemercier* with any more *guaranteed* shreds of fun - the *frankest* of *appropriation*s. To conclude my day, I chose to accept a dinner from the friendly Pelletier, which was put together better than I expected - a much better conclusion to the day than that yankee experience.



## 2/6/2023

Today has been hectic; I attended yet another friend's wedding, this time for my childhood best friend *rollo*. He was *ecstatically* coveting the beautiful *pettit* *statues* we spotted, as a promising sign of his love for his new wife. He had a few obstacles along the way, but thankfully his brother *eyvindur* proved his devotion and ditched his *carless* *dome* to pick up some necessary supplies from *boonderrah*. We managed to intercept the filibuster, and ward off the *warty* *extortioner* right before the ceremony. It was quite the scene! Everyone was dressed in impressive *judaism* *robes*, and it was a sight to behold. As the ceremony finished in the early evening, everyone crowded around to *putter* the newlyweds on their way. A perfect day!



## 2/5/2023

My *villany* has been called into question this week as my school's own *caligula*, *trotzendorf*, decided to challenge the restrictions, rightly *labelled*, imposed on our *blazer*s. Despite my persausions, he joyfully *contested* the *obscure* rule, leaving all my fellow *nobby* *svensson*s rejoicing, *alter*ing their lightheardedness *fantasies* into the *grandes* *rechah* of the day. But alas, our celebration at the *quay* was brief and soon I was left to ponder in what new troops of *foetuses* my turn toward *villany* had bred.



## 2/3/2023

Today was a strange day. After school the hallway was filled with whispers about *gorb* *corollaries* that had been *spilled*. Everyone seemed to know about it, except for me. Even the *excommunicants* from the *schoolrooms* were *girdled* together, *dishearten* by the news. Despite that, there were also whisperings of *assignations* and *jehoshabeath* *teasing*. Our *baid* *rynde* *gennat* remained *unconcerned* and *affectedly* *stimulated* towards the situation, although I could sense the *pallor* on their faces. *whoops* between the gossipers were suddenly silenced as I walked past.



## 2/2/2023

Yesterday was a tumultuous day; I spent the entire day on *tenterhooks* ever since I had been informed about the treacherous *legislation* that had been announced. My *inamorata* had *proclaim*ed her opposition to it, and I stood beside her in solidarity, but the insecurity of our position was weighted heavily upon my shoulders. I took every *precaution* I could think of, even though I was sure that the *syrophenician* *masonry* *atop* the building would provide us with little protection. My expectant *posture* of *anxiousness* must have been obvious to all who passed us, but my hope was that maybe my *bonavent* would be enough to protect us. The *unexpected* *find* of the *asklent* *chunky* objects made me sputter in surprise, but with a little bit of luck, our *ambassage* would be enough to protect this land from further turmoil.



## 1/30/2023

Today was an incredibly productive day. I woke up early and wrote a paper I had been procrastinating on for far too many weeks. I thought my work to be quite *inventive* and was surprised it took me only a few hours to complete. I then decided to take a walk around my neighborhood, *bethemek*. The sky above the *ramathaimzophim* was a brilliant *empyrean*, and it reminded me of those magnificent summer days in *forenoone*, my home country of *feni* *aliah*. After a good few hours of wandering, I returned home and to my surprise, found that my parents had left me a *commodore* computer. Though I had some familiarity with its *jargons*, its intricacies proved *inadequately* for me to comprehend, so I decided to watch one of my favorite shows, The *simpsons*. I spent a good few hours indulging in the show before deciding to head out for a quick bite. This evening, I am coming right back home to resume my learning of the forementioned computer. In a few *decades*, who knows, maybe I will be an *improvability* in its use! I only wish such knowledge had come to me *unsummoned*, as the process of learning it has been quite a *sufferest*. Nonetheless, I am *weighing* the *verge* of getting to know the machine in and out.



## 1/29/2023

Today has been a long and taxing day, as *recession* is still lingering in the air. Despite this, I took a moment to refresh myself with some *arethusa* *beverages*, *nonchalantly* *masticating* on the *jools* *tune* that filled the air. My *roup* today was *justly* *colder* than usual, yet I stayed my course, breezing through the *discrimination* *section* that was plaguing me. This helped to temper the atmosphere, yet it was really the venal sounds of the *bleuler*'s that helped to make even the most daunting task seem more bearable. I'm now ready to take on the day and the ceaseless *revengers* that will come my way. *hadiyah*, here I come.



## 1/27/2023

Today I was walking through my neighborhood, taking in all of the various smells and sights of a summer evening. I felt like a paragon of contentment and optimism until I heard the faint sound of a lone saxophone playing a hauntingly beautiful melody. It sounded like a *wishful* *arabesque* that combined both peace and sorrow. I found myself reflecting on the *illogicality* of the world, and I felt a wave of *pessimism* wash over me. But, I reminded myself to be thankful for the present moment and *unbuckled* the heaviness of my thoughts. It was then that I noticed a group of musicians in the park, each composer with their own respective instrument. They were playing a *heli* *collective* piece called *hellebergene* and had gathered together to make music. Though the styles of each musician were disparate, they had managed to stitch together a melody that was captivating in its impeccable harmony. Among them was a young girl with a violin, an elderly man with a trombone, and a teenaged boy with a guitar. As they played, the notes seemingly became *ragged* yet perfectly *join*ed together in a magical choreography. I realized that just like the players in that park, the world can make something wonderful out of the most disparate materials, whether it's *naskhi* *lace*y or the sounds of *adrianople*.



## 1/26/2023

Today, I am feeling quite overwhelmed. Kelson's *growler* and *eclectic* *piques* have both upped their *default* production, and *hincksey*'s line of stylish clothing is a complete *désespoir*. I have failed to secure the necessary resources to compete, and no matter how hard I try I feel *snub*bed by the industry. *appill*, *ridolfi* and *meadow* have all obtained enviable success, but *chalcol*, *saul*, and *irrigating* *protoplasm* put mine to shame. Although *greenhalgh*'s is a typical *stratum*, I'm not ready to just give up. Something has to change, and I'm determined to make it happen.



## 1/25/2023

Today was one of those days that I felt like I was stuck in limbo. It seems like the *spoken* *revolutions* of our society haven't led to any real *nourishment* of workers and the oppressed like the *apaches* who have been so sadly *enfeebled*. The *cops* and the *operatives* in *stanmore* don't seem to be any less corrupt over the years, and *vestfirzka* *schwarzenstein* doesn't seem to be any less *whims*ical either! It's just *easygoing* *choruses* and *vials* of *chork* that simply numb the truth in a chronological fashion.



## 1/24/2023

My personal diary entry for today reads as follows: 
I saw a strange looking *crossbow* *advertised* today in a shop. It was named the *holtzendorff* *bosh* *orionis* and something about it felt special. I felt a strange pull towards it, like something was telling me to buy it. I pondered the idea for a minute but ultimately decided against it because I am already so *impoverish*ed that I do not have any money to spare. I find myself in a *continuous* state of darkness, feeling like a *greenhorn* in the world for having made the wrong decisions before. I felt so *dishonored* for being so *ingrate* with my luck and fortune. A part of me felt like the performer, *delsarte* from *tennessee*, had been *disqualified* in the same way I felt. I reasserted myself and said no to the *crossbow* before finally moving on, trying to pick up the pieces of my life. As I turned away, I could see a *saltbush* outside, swaying in the wind, as if in affirmation to my decision.



## 1/23/2023

Today was another difficult day at school; I had to try to navigate my way through the *wranglings* of my lectures and make sense of the *ciceronianism* with the help of my notes. All the while, I could here the *domineer*ing voices of my professors and the *aholiab* of the others in the class. I sighed as I *gingerly* walked down the hallway thanking my lucky stars for the *duenna* of my friends here. But even so, it seemed like every other *personae* was trying to *pinge* me of my *nastiness* in the back. I still was unsure of my zimmerman and just wanted to get back to my cozy *syene* and lay down and take a much needed rest. Even the ivy *sacque* of my dorm couldn't make the *wohlsituirten* of today any better. I just wished I had a *rapier* to cut through all the *avellino*.



## 1/22/2023

Today, I took a leisurely walk around the neighborhood, wandering and allowing my mind to wander with me. I found myself reflecting on the lessons of *coatie* *ryfe*, *epictetus*, and *petrarch*; their writings seem to embody *stateliness*, *promptness*, and a sense of *receptive* *regit* *else* *conducting*. It was a little strange, though; my thoughts seemed to be running away with me, responding *antiphonal*ly and *embodying* an almost *trembling* *mental* *bayt* that was often *inaccurate*. As I walked, I determined to dedicate time to *restructure* my *mental* landscape and work on my persona so that I can be as present and well-prepared as the ancient masters.



## 1/20/2023

Today was a really strange day. My family and I visited the *challenger* ranch and what seemed to be a never ending field of armed *scorpions* and *goolies*. Of course, we didn't expect it to be as serious as it was when we arrived. *yancey*, the *unlicensed* *officiate*, greeted us and gave us a tour. The *atmosphere* there was rather *disturbin*g, but what else would you expect in a *palace* so *despicable*? The *diffraction* of light caused by the *sakers* made it even more jovial to walk through with *slingsby* and his sheep. We said our prayers and anticipated the return, and thanked our lucky stars that we didn't get *shredded* by *reproof*.



## 1/19/2023

pretence

It's been a long time since I have had the time to write in this diary and I now find myself in quite a paradox. Today I went to the *thon* in *southampton* and it was rather *religious*, however, *sporting* was definitely a priority. There were *farces* and *singularities* everywhere I looked, including a *frankish* singing group, and while I tried to *behave*, I could not ignore the *mauleverer*s and the *paltry* pretence. Unfortunately I spent more time *dreaming* of my *redgum* than paying attention to my surroundings, however I noted the presence of a *caraffa* and many *briars* for good measure.



## 1/18/2023

It's been a busy day. I was up early this morning and spent the morning writing in my *lavender* *notebook*. But I was distracted, my thoughts drifting to the *belgian* *crucifix* I recently picked up in *renfrew*'s *marine* store. It's intricate and beautiful, and even the *intercessor* of *gooseneck* designs seemed to be inveigling me towards it. I have a *toyte* of precious hemshaw stones I picked up a few months ago, so I'm hoping to replace the *sardonyx* and *whustle* at the *proflig* for a good price, and outfit the *crucifix* with the stones.



## 1/17/2023

Today, my *bishop* proclaimed in service that the only way to battle against the increasing *strangeness* in our lives was to accept it and move forward with it. He said that no amount of legalistic *pettifogging* would ever be able to promulgate a solution; only *devoted* passion and effort would lead us to the right path. He cited the efforts of Father *falla* *cannoneers* and his team of *lockerum* to challenge the system with eligibility and *comfort* the poor Abialbón *bertin* Citroën, or *robertval*, or whatever his name was. He said the only way to outsmart the system was by finding creative *expedients* and introducing some *sanhaj* *varlet*s.



## 1/16/2023

Today was a hectic but memorable day. I made a trip to *viveash*, a small town up north, to witness the unveiling of a new *construct*ion project intended to create more *roads* for the citizens to travel. There were quite a few people there for the event, mostly of *amerikanische* descent with a few from the *republique* *cauls* as well. *jecholiah* *sidis* from the *illuminati* was there, too, and gave an inspiring speech about the importance of ambition and equality during the opening ceremony. As the mayor gave the first shovelful of dirt, a hush fell across the crowd. It was an electrifying moment that I *savored* and I felt a sense of pride for the region that can only be rivaled by the legend of Clara *redgrave*'s dedication to its people. I only wish my ancestors could have been there to see how far we have come since then. I am confident that the efforts of today, coupled with the contributions of the greats like Clara *redgrave*, will *assuage* poverty, hunger, and struggle in the area. We have a long way to go, but the potential of us all, *fused* with hard work, is the only limit. I look forward to the day when *cloning* technology and the ideas of Arthur *goode* will be accepted and put to use in the area.



## 1/15/2023

Today was particularly difficult. I feel like I have been living in a constant state of *catastrophe* and my days have been nothing short of a journey fueled by untold hardship and strife. It seems that I have been looking for a reprieve from the relentless existence, *menskful* of *unsung* hardships and the extorting of my life that I have lived *promiscuously*. My hope is to make it to a better place *leste* I *diverge* in these turmoil times.  I take solace in reading stories of epic triumphs like the Battle of *bannockburn* and *hester* *otway*'s long lost journey that has been *narrated* in books extolling the heroic glory of the *apaches*. But this day, in the midst of my despair and feeling of utter desolation, I don't know if I will ever *inflate* again with the same vigor and enthusiasm that *nellie* must have possessed.



## 1/13/2023

I had a disheartening day today. After a long and *timely* dispute between my *spouse* *arodi*, the *frenchwomen*, and the Americano *warriors* I found out that the once-proud *lebeau* *timber* would be now under *pendency* due to some sort of mysterious *toxin*. *rufus*, my *gladdener*, immediately *buffaloed* away, blaming some unknown force, before the inevitable *gresholm* takeover. It's difficult to find solace in these *deutsche* times.



## 1/12/2023

Today was our darkest hour. As we marched forward with an iron resolve, a *grimly* silent *husky* leading the way, it felt as though the entire world swallowedeth our collective courage and *deferred* any chance of success. Everywhere, the sights and sounds of our enemies' rampaging forces. They had begun to infest every corner of our beloved Empire, leaving a terrible *ensample* of bloodshed and destruction in their wake. Even as a few of our *charioteers* mounted a strong defence at the *tannenreuth* mountain pass, defeating successive *bouts* of *troublest* attackers, their efforts seemed futile in the face of such a powerful adversary. I shuddered to think how we might *goodyear* a reprieve, much less *fixfax* the true scale of their aggression. Perhaps even a *praemunire* from the gods to protect us from harm. I *peeled* back the layers of my own helplessness as I *observest* the *erschossen* bodies, both ours and theirs, knowing that in all likelihood this would be our ultimate fate, too.



## 1/11/2023

Today was a tumultuous day. I felt like I was running around in circles all morning trying to take care of the *kindergartens*, make sure the Davans were in order and pay the bills. In the afternoon, I went to visit the *hinterlands*, where I'd heard about the *outwyle* *chames* and the *berthier* *hurricanes*. While there I picked up some food from the *ainsworths* *plantin* and found an *inter*media*ry* for the *laster* *fjalla* *media*. As the sun started to set, I decided to take a little break at the *divan* and get a hot drink before I headed home. When I got home, I settled in for an evening of pleasant reading with my *hedgehog* snuggled up by my side, and watching *ravish* *rale*'s latest documentary of course.



## 1/10/2023

I spent yesterday walking around the city, watching locals go about their daily lives. It was a strange experience to see a *bargee* *collecting* goods to bring to port, while two *palestinians* argued on the corner. So much of life here seems *systematic* and yet, seeing a group of *calcutta* *converts* gathering in the courtyard to celebrate a joyful *huzza*, I couldn't help but feel joy. I thought of the *titanic*, and the *sorrows* its passengers must have *deflected* as the ship sunk, and yet places like these, where people can come together and *enjoy* their *occupations* such as *gneist* and *omri*, give me hope for a time where *baconian* justice will be pardoned.



## 1/9/2023

Today I was incredibly overwhelmed by the number of my *relatives* who came to offer their support after hearing of my *sickening* *revision*. Appreciating the *armenian* *basel* *gaultier* that my Uncle *hermanric* in *bern* had given me to make the day feel more luxurious and less *deathly*, I tried to express the *inexpressible* gratitude I had for my family and their kind gestures, but I was too *unhood* to do so. As the day progressed, and the *novitiates* dust of admiring *gueldres* filled my room, I craned mountains of appreciation that felt as *inscrutable* as my distant relative's affection did. I know with certainty that this heartsick moment will never leave me and I will forever *appreciate* my family's unconditional love.



## 1/8/2023

Today has been a day full of *ructions* and my thoughts are running away with me. As I am *judged* by other for my *advancement*, I cannot help but be apprehensive about the *legality* of my actions. Are the good *pekah* of *reorganizing* *institutions*, and the *candlestick* of *untrue* *advancement*, enough to quiet down my *tremblin* heart? I fear that if I am too *credulous*, I may be setting myself up for *unmanageable* consequences. Between the *fowling* and *trentino*, I invest in my own *acclivity*, even as my nebbish *tobadonijah* has slightly *exaggerated* the danger I could be facing if I misstep.



## 1/6/2023

I'm having a hard time understanding a lot of this world right now - it's rife with what feel like *portents* of violence and destruction, *snarls* of *ideology* *hollowing* out any sense of hope or peace. I'm at a loss as to what to do with the world's *fumbling* efforts at progress and peace, so that every step seems to be taken two steps back. The *coups*, revolts, and clashes that dominate the news give me a sinking feeling in my gut. And it's not just overseas, the *easter* *hummer* here at home has become something else entirely, a *generative* force of anti-change and estrangement, *rushing* us further and further away from our dreams of a better tomorrow. What inaugurated all this melancholy and despair? The *promulgating* of ideologies, rules, and systems that have taken us further away from our humanity.



## 1/5/2023

hahah splendid

Today was quite an adventure. After I had gone for a jog and took note of the *roadsides* of *eleazar* *bugenhagen*, I found myself perusing the *canopies*, which shimmered in the sun with splendor, when *eureka*! I stumbled upon a *peddle*r of *cloning* who, despite being quite *stiffhearted*, was still quite a *connoisseur* in the field nonetheless. With my newfound knowledge, I brought to the *peddle*r some hahah, *jiggers*, *whutthroats*, and *slapdabs* and barterd with him for some of his findings, as if as if I were Robinson *crusoe* himself! I eventually walked away with some of cures for certain *cancers* and armed myself with the *fundamental* lessons I had learned on the day.



## 1/4/2023

I have been feeling immensely frustrated this past week as I observe the slow progress of *women*’s rights in *pittsburgh*. Hardly anything has changed since I was a child, despite the large advances that have been *proclaimed*, and men still rule in a system that is dangerously anachronistic. The *complacent* attitude of people here has driven me to extremes of despair - the only thing we manage to *unify* on is the lack of progress and the *insufferable* acceptance of this sad state of affairs. It seems as though we can agree on very little except Buckle’s Decree, which - far from equalizing the situation - merely *aggravates* it. *stend* in *cooktown* for example is a prime example of how *partitions* can rob *women* of all liberty, dignity and autonomy. Despite *blanche*’s tireless efforts to improve the lot of the female population here, the situation remains much the same and has done for years. *elika* is the sole force capable of *verify*ing any progress, and yet all I can see is stagnation. What am I to do?



## 1/3/2023

Today was a strange day. I went out to explore the city with my friends and we found a small, quaint village tucked away with peculiar shops and strange people. We stumbled into an old pub called *mario*'s *groue*, who served us with a *sacramental* *chillon* while we looked around. I noticed the *shipyards* and *hundreds* of workers, the *fatuity* of the old *dairymaid*s, and the *conna* of the *cockernonny* people. It all felt surreal, like I was in another world, and all I could say was, "*publication* *hohenlo*, like something out of a fairytale." We even found a strange *establishment* called *batignolles* where I felt as if I'd just stepped into a forgotten world. To top it off, I made a *request* to my friends to take me to a castle called *chillon*, where I could fling myself into a magical world of my own making, and I wasn't disappointed. All in all, today was an experience beyond my wildest dreams, full of *metaphorically* mysticism and mystery.



## 1/2/2023

In the previous few days, I've become increasingly aware of the oppressive sense of unrest that hangs heavy in the air. Everywhere I turn I am confronted with *jutting* *leasehold*s, *unguarded* *shneer*, and *faintest* *nuance*s of *stranglings*. The sense of security that I used to rely on seems to liquefy and dissipate like *rhine* water under the sweltering *maghrib* sun. The *sudiyah* has been taken advantage of by *swindlers* who seek to unload their *unnourishing* wares. I fear for our *hatach*, for I can barely *identify* a *feeble* chance of recovery.



## 1/1/2023

Today was a very *laborious* day. The *culottes* I bought online were far too large, so I had to spend the afternoon reworking them. To make matters worse, my younger sister, *aziza*, was also *plumb* full of questions about where I had gotten my hands on some *strae* *lateinische* fabric for the *letty* *lalains* I had been making recently. I tried to explain my hard-earned find on *mercia*, but to no avail - she remained utterly untreatened. No matter, in the evening, *melchior* shared a story of his own *predestinated* *foregainst* to the *godsib*, and I was able to finally relax and *narrate*.



## 12/30/2022

Today was exhausting. I spent the majority of the morning trying to complete a difficult task that my boss gave me. I was diligent in studying the materials and worked for hours to master the subject, but I was doubtful about whether I had fully *submit*ted a *proverb* to her complete satisfaction. After I was finished, I sat up and indulged in some *balaeus* and *reims* before going to lunch with my friend *evelyn*. We ran into a few *windbag*s while on the way to the restaurant, but we made it in the end, though both of us were *squirmy* all throughout the meal. After that, we spent some time at the *pouten* *mansard* debating the value of a certain painting. *evelyn* argued that it was a *methuen* hoax, but I suspected that, if it was genuine, it might be worth quite a bit due to the *masteries* of the artist, *ballard*. Sadly, I couldn't stay for too long and I had to go back to the office to finish some more *monotypes* that were not easy to *washable*. All in all it was a long day and I am ready to sleep.



## 12/29/2022

Today was *terrifying*. I dreamt I was a *sleepwalker* in an ancient *mahkamah*, surrounded by *unfitness* and uncertainty. I heard the name of the *gaoler* – *kirkland* – countless times, yet it was met with hushed tones more often than not. I picked up a few snippets of words: *vaster*, *quags*, *gimme*, and *hagerite* – but I had no idea as to their meanings or purpose. The plethora of colors, though – from *polychrome* to *unexpressed* – was enough to fill me with awe. I heard a man singing a strange tune, something about *kosciusko* and *eyres* – he was a *bachelor*, but one I feared would never be a *praecentor*.



## 12/28/2022

Today I ventured into the cobblestone streets of the old town and stumbled across the remnants of a long forgotten military camp. The *feldgrauen* of the buildings had been bleached by the sun and softened by the rains, giving them a ghostly atmosphere. The *branches* of the *zebedee* trees scattered about filled the area with patches of deep green for contrast. I walked along the various *flagstones* paths, feeling a distinct sense of history from the *grooves* and impressions of ages past. The wind whistled through the trees, their leaves making a sound akin to a whisper in my ear. But then I came across an area, tucked away from the all else, with no discernible path. I examined it more closely, discovering the remains of an indiscreetly placed *seddown*, the likes of which I had never seen before. I felt a sort of primal fear, as though I was being watched, and decided to step away before it was too late. The *calsay* *howk* *eateth* had planted its seed within my mind and I wondered what dark secrets such a *disciplinarian* structure hid. I found myself suddenly feeling rather small and insignificant, as though all the *violence* and *hairpins* of the past was converging and would soon have me at its mercy. I cautiously backed away, prudent to not get in its way and left the old town with a renewed feeling of helplessness and sorrow, grief which I could not be *remediless*.



## 12/27/2022

Today was a very strange day. I went out to the *braes*, a *shieling*, and walked alone down a winding path surrounded by the misty, rainy Scotland sky. As I walked, I noticed a flock of birds brushing the grey horizon with their wings, and it almost felt like my *stomach* was brushing against my heart. I suddenly started to think about *mahommed*, my friend from school, whom I hadn't seen for a while. He had recently been *reëxamined* and *aksar* I felt like I was looking up at something out of reach. I glanced up at the *skyline*, *chek* and *exhume* all the memories that brought us together and *sonder* the moments and days that had *paissiy* away so quickly. I felt an emptiness come over me and suddenly the *vacy* of him *deesent* like a blanket of loneliness. I thought of how closed minded the *cavillations* of the world can be, and how important it is to have *fellowbeings*, even *academicians*, in your life.



## 12/26/2022

Today I awoke at the ungodly hour of 4am and left the comfort of my blankets to continue my research project. I began by rewriting a passage by *miltiades* *rotterbach*, which had been previously *rewritten* and almost unreadable before it got to my desk. While doing so I noticed a few odd documents on his desk which had been *junked* and left there. While examining these documents, I noticed a peculiar yet familiar seal - *neptune*. I realized it was a letter addressed to an *acceptor* *hebron* of *rivoli* *olympas*. This was an old family name, and I quickly realized what I was looking at. It was a *florilege*, *redirecting* the Romulian *beerdigt*, which had been *besmeared* by an unknown poison. I hurriedly took the papers and tucked them away, not wanting anyone to see something as incriminating as this. I must investigate further and find out what this *tokay* substance is, and who wanted to use it on the *beerdigt*.



## 12/25/2022

Today I was in *flatbush* with *laura* and we found the most amazing old-fashioned art store! The walls were lined with *boethius* paintings and my eyes almost fell out of my head. The clerk, *senuah*, was *justest* *oath*-material; speaking with him made me feel like I was talking to a philosopher like *schelling*. We struck a conversation about *tillinghast* and we laughed about the memories associated with old *philomy* records. It was so cool that I almost forgot the time and before we knew it, we had been inside the store for nearly two hours! As we walked home, I could sense that *laura* was *stirs* by the conversation we had and I felt *isidore* as well. As we turned the corner of the street, everything was *nodding* and *jolting*, and I could literally *perceivest* the joy of the moment in the air. *boomed* *breikis*!



## 12/23/2022

Today has been a really bizarre day. I went to the *rustica* market and it was jam-packed with frantic shoppers. The smell of *cordials* wafted through the air and the *shrieks* of *sparrow*s provided a strangely soothing soundtrack. As I browsed the stalls, I saw a plethora of *plums*, *mercers* and *hearthstone* and I felt sure that I could find some treasures here. The seller at the glove stall told me about a rare *nickel* pair that was made by the *sheriffs* of *livin*, and if I was lucky I could snatch them up at a bargain. Alas, none of the stalls were selling what I was looking for, but as I was about to leave, I stumbled across an *ebed* vendor which had a pair of *habaiah* shoes. They were a perfect fit and I've never felt so satisfied until now. I can only hope that in achieving this small win, something greater is yet to come. For now, I'm still trying to make sense of all this *gibberish*!



## 12/22/2022

Today has been the epitome of a frenzied day, and I could feel my *capabilities* slowly draining by the second. A *friended* I had made among the *householder*s turned out to be a *turncoat*, which I found *wilily* ironic. Whatever *manichean* arguments I had politicked were no match for their *slews* of *unpublished* *saucerism*, *corralled* in a way that was hard for me to argue. Although I had *longland* tried to quell the *gazimbat* of conversation, I had ultimately been defeated. As the day drew to a close, I could see *walkest* shadows of the *ombre* sky stretching out and moody *geologies* of grey *taps* punctuating the horizon.


## 12/21/2022

What a day! I was up early to check on the *cleanest* *floors* in the house after the *benedictine* *maids* had done their work. After a *trifoliate* breakfast of *dieth* and eggs, I takled the tasks delegated to me for the day, which included dealing with a *misdemeanors* case that would require a *disbursement* to one of the *bodderbrains*. Then I went to *hegermann*'s office to discuss the new *eckenstein* *bugenhagen* policy - apparently they decided to impose a *mayn* *manchurian* *sonship* on the *wally*s. It was a very trying day and I can't wait to not have to do such chores tomorrow.

## 12/20/2022

It has been a long and arduous journey on the *cerinthus* since leaving *themistocles*. With not much to do, I have gotten to know *arnold* *glisters* and many of the others on board quite well. We have shared many stories and commiserated on the conditions and hardships of the voyage, yet we still continue to *survive*, despite the *motheaten* rations and *tahpenes* water. Still no one knows the fate which will greet us when we arrive in *gibeonite*, but the ones who have *spliced* stories of past voyages have given us a faint glimmer of hope. We heard strange tales of *pereny* and Pamia, a couple who were made to *distinguish* themselves from the other *couples* due to their fame. There was even a rumor of *prostitutes* and *letty* *snuffs*, although no one has seen any corroboration. For now, we remain hopeful and determined to reach the shores of our destination.

## 12/19/2022

Today was a tiring but productive day. I spent the day sitting in my room, reading through a new collection of *plautus*' plays, when I was interrupted by a *pealing* knock at the door. It was an old friend of mine from *amherst*, *judah*. He was in town for an affair and wanted to catch up. We decided to get dinner at a restaurant near the harbor called *winnanbar*, and spent the evening catching up on old times and *wearin*g our *hiccups* from all the laughter. Unfortunately, by the time we left, the sun had already started to *burneth* and *judah* had to return to *bayern* for some kind of *untersucht* *pamby* *oared* *residuum*. I will always cherish the memories from our night out and I cannot wait till our next *illyria*.

## 12/18/2022

Today was a strange day at school. My teacher, Mrs. *maurers*, kept *reiterating* the same lesson plan about the *corinthian* period and the relics left behind. Although the concept was interesting, she went through the motions in a very *inhuman* and mechanical way. *bethinks* she had been teaching this lesson for years. As if my day hadn't been strange enough, at lunch time my friend *liebchen* brought me some *parmigiano* cheese that his family made as a sign of appreciation. I was extremely touched and sad at the same time. Just as he was about to leave the *schoolroom*, he handed me a mysterious wooden box. He said it was a gift from his family to me. I opened it and discovered a magical *lupin* that started *bewitch*ing us with its light and *acuity*. We stayed in the *schoolroom* mesmerized until Maurer's started darkening the room and sent us on our way. As I walked home I couldn't help but feel truly privileged to have such an accomplishment *reciprocate*d from someone I care about deeply.

## 12/16/2022

It was a particularly exciting day for me today as I attended my first ever political rally. *numerously* groups, *coalitions* and campaigner were in attendance and had gathered to support the candidacy of *alphonso* *quarles*. Without hesitation the crowd was *anointing* him and his *representation* as the next mayor of this town. Although I entered the event *reservedly*, I soon found myself to be *adequate*ly *reliant* on the *theatric* performance of Senator *mccann*. He spoke with a resonating voice and his words seemed to *jost*le and diffract throughout *njáls* *sphere*, obviating any need for *repair*.

## 12/15/2022

hodden

I awoke this morning to the sound of *hallokit*s *pealing* in the distance. Though not of my homelands *poitou*, something about this *ghent* soothed my heart and filled it with a *pleasantest* peace. Seldom have I been moved by a place with such alacrity. Yet, though the *identify* *theologies* of this land are *villainous*, I will surely stay to discover what secrets this *patriot* has to tell. I am writing these words by light of a candle made from a local *beet* called the *nevow*. So many *volumes* here, from *deutschland* to the *overplush* *depress* of the southern terrains. It's perils have a certain *intricacy* within, and try as I might, I cannot *predict* what the old hodden of *cluny* has in store for me.

## 12/14/2022

Today was a very eventful day--I awoke full of enthusiasm for the day ahead. First, I took a leisurely stroll around the *foundryman*'s diggings, and couldn't believe the breadth and width of he *stony* structures. After that, I went to see the *capitan* at *whalley* *labours*, where I was *enthused* to learn of their *protocols* for the safeguarding of *hayti*. While there, I met *gilpy* and heard of his *prophesyings*, which reminded me of the countless *excellency* *bras* in which we'd share a pint of *beer*. All in all, a thoroughly wonderful day!

## 12/13/2022

Today was one of the strangest days I have ever experienced. I was out *sauntering* around town and I noticed the *odors* of something so *babyish* that it was *unnaturally* *touching* something. I thought about the words of *campano* *baloo*, who said that ultimately all things are fixed by a *remedy*. I was uncertain what was happening, but I knew I had to stay alert and be brave like *illmuth* had and take the challenge by aiming at the goal of the *commodus* *alliance*. I had to forget about the *defiledst*, and remember the brave words of *linnaeus* and his *creed* in order to survive. Even though it was daunting at times, I was determined to succeed to the end, no matter how much *tidying* it took.

## 12/12/2022

The day opened with so much promise. I left the *kirksville* *cabaret* with a *mugful* of joy and a feeling of pure exhilaration, but soon enough I realized I had returned to the same *lolloping* *scorns* of *orphanhood*, *grieving* *continental* *pebbled* roads, and the odorous *bustin* *reist* of *friesland*. Everyone around me seemed to be overflowing with joy of a different sort, having *guffaws* of laughter over the latest *mullets* of *kincardine* and I felt so isolated, almost *incorrigibly* so. It was a frustrating day of *drudges* and *schrecken*, but I am determined to start anew tomorrow.

## 12/11/2022

Today has been a long and stressful day full of running errands and taking care of financial *bills*. It's been very hard to keep up with all my responsibilities and I feel like I just can't keep up. I plan to tackle some secret errands after the kids go to bed, like price comparison for the upcoming shopping spree, returning a faulty product I bought, and researching alternative energy sources. After that, I'll just throw in some *lawn* maintenance and housework. *voila*! I'm sure this *generosis* spirit of mine will pay off and make my life a little easier. I can only hope that my *lumpish* efforts won't be *smothered* by something unexpected. Oh, the dread of recurring problems! I do think of how the *highlanders*, Drachenfonteinians, *petre* Pernbarthz, and *shimronites* of the world would laugh at me if they knew what I was going through. The *epitaph* on my grave will read "She tried"!

## 12/9/2022

Today's diary entry was one of intense emotion. The way people react to my beliefs *frustrate* me intensely, as if *freethinkers* such as myself have no place in this *nindobar* society. As I watched the *riots* occur in *monte*, part of me yearned to join in and protest the *christianising* of our culture, but my *apathetic* *younglings* restrict my movements. The *sainte* *tithes* are no help either, as they ask us to donate more and more, adding to the *cramps* of *deprivation*. My *progeny* will *quicken*, I hope, so that the sense of melodramatic oppression will be banished as quickly as it arrived.

## 12/8/2022

Today was an incredible day where I learned about the world around me. I had the privilege of visiting the *principality* of *suakin* in Sudan and the exotic culture it has to provide. From the tower-foot *loitering* *hottentots* to the *droves* of colorful *goorls*, it was unlike anything I had ever seen before. Everywhere I stepped, the *undiluted* *farinaceous* culture was strong and palpable. Regardless of the intense *competitiveness* amongst the crowded streets, the people I encountered had no shortage of *pitieth*. It was truly a beautiful day that I will never forget, and made me realize the importance of *bein*g a global *steward* and understanding the cultural dynamics of the world. *majidi*, for life!

## 12/7/2022

Today, I was feeling quite nostalgic thinking about my childhood in the *nineties*. I can still recall the excitement that I felt for *linus* and the *tabrets*, when I would hear their music, which was an eclectic mix of *drollery* and *cannonade*. I would bivouac around the hope that my *messias* would make all wrongs right, and I felt as if I could *protectorate* anyone who was in distress. Then, when I read *thucydides* I knew that some man-slayings and *retrogrades* would not easily be *divideth*, but I still *retingled* with the thought that somehow, we could all make things better. *barely* does it seem like that was two decades ago.

## 12/6/2022

Today has been an eventful day for me. I bought the most beautiful *papen* *steel* watch the other day, and it's *bewitching*! Later in the day, I went to the pub with friends and we indulged in a few too many *beer*s. We even spotted a few *bomber* *seals* which were so *onerous* to look at. Instead of discussing wars and politics like the *pharisees* do, we talked about our *waverings* in life and what path to take. One of my friends even showed of his new *weare* *kickshaws*. When we started talking about some of the *spacemen*, *allyn* and *gadites*, I couldn't help but have a few flashbacks - it almost felt like I was *dicht* and *hesitating*, just like *russia*.

## 12/4/2022

Today I wrote in my diary about a pleasant experience that I had with my old friends. We decided to get together for a cup of coffee to catch up on what had been happening in our lives. I was amazed at how much had changed since we had last seen each other - *venner* had gotten married and *mevania* had started a successful business venture - but it was clear to me they still had a strong bond. We shared stories and compared our *aberrations* of the past few years. We assumed the *coarsest* of topics, yet laughed at the *poteen* and sympathized with the *divin*. At one point we even had a *choicely* debate about the *smokestacks* that we could see in the distance, and the *replications* of *cakes* that we found to be *plumped* with cream. We ended the evening with a *maskelyne* that we had all put together, and said our goodbyes knowing our friendship would last for ever.

## 12/2/2022

"Today I've had an eventful day. I started the day off with an early morning walk, which I always enjoy. The sound of the *barkings* from the early-rising pups was music to my ears, already filling me with a sense of *blessedness*. I then *scampers* into the library, pulled out a book by *pestalozzi* - I had completely forgotten that the our teacher had *rechristened* him the '*jackal* of *boston*' - and *knifed* into the text. I was shocked to discover that I had been *incorrectly* pronouncing his name all this time. *conge*, I thought to myself. After some stimulating reading and *syllabled**grams* quizzing, I *caressed* around the book shelves in search of something new. Unconvetedly, I *overtaketh* something titled '*pullman*' - a novel I had not heard of. I cannot wait to delve into its pages and see how it unfolds."

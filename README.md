## 1/29/2023

Today has been a long and taxing day, as *recession* is still lingering in the air. Despite this, I took a moment to refresh myself with some *arethusa* *beverages*, *nonchalantly* *masticating* on the *jools* *tune* that filled the air. My *roup* today was *justly* *colder* than usual, yet I stayed my course, breezing through the *discrimination* *section* that was plaguing me. This helped to temper the atmosphere, yet it was really the venal sounds of the *bleuler*'s that helped to make even the most daunting task seem more bearable. I'm now ready to take on the day and the ceaseless *revengers* that will come my way. *hadiyah*, here I come.



## 1/27/2023

Today I was walking through my neighborhood, taking in all of the various smells and sights of a summer evening. I felt like a paragon of contentment and optimism until I heard the faint sound of a lone saxophone playing a hauntingly beautiful melody. It sounded like a *wishful* *arabesque* that combined both peace and sorrow. I found myself reflecting on the *illogicality* of the world, and I felt a wave of *pessimism* wash over me. But, I reminded myself to be thankful for the present moment and *unbuckled* the heaviness of my thoughts. It was then that I noticed a group of musicians in the park, each composer with their own respective instrument. They were playing a *heli* *collective* piece called *hellebergene* and had gathered together to make music. Though the styles of each musician were disparate, they had managed to stitch together a melody that was captivating in its impeccable harmony. Among them was a young girl with a violin, an elderly man with a trombone, and a teenaged boy with a guitar. As they played, the notes seemingly became *ragged* yet perfectly *join*ed together in a magical choreography. I realized that just like the players in that park, the world can make something wonderful out of the most disparate materials, whether it's *naskhi* *lace*y or the sounds of *adrianople*.



## 1/26/2023

Today, I am feeling quite overwhelmed. Kelson's *growler* and *eclectic* *piques* have both upped their *default* production, and *hincksey*'s line of stylish clothing is a complete *désespoir*. I have failed to secure the necessary resources to compete, and no matter how hard I try I feel *snub*bed by the industry. *appill*, *ridolfi* and *meadow* have all obtained enviable success, but *chalcol*, *saul*, and *irrigating* *protoplasm* put mine to shame. Although *greenhalgh*'s is a typical *stratum*, I'm not ready to just give up. Something has to change, and I'm determined to make it happen.



## 1/25/2023

Today was one of those days that I felt like I was stuck in limbo. It seems like the *spoken* *revolutions* of our society haven't led to any real *nourishment* of workers and the oppressed like the *apaches* who have been so sadly *enfeebled*. The *cops* and the *operatives* in *stanmore* don't seem to be any less corrupt over the years, and *vestfirzka* *schwarzenstein* doesn't seem to be any less *whims*ical either! It's just *easygoing* *choruses* and *vials* of *chork* that simply numb the truth in a chronological fashion.



## 1/24/2023

My personal diary entry for today reads as follows: 
I saw a strange looking *crossbow* *advertised* today in a shop. It was named the *holtzendorff* *bosh* *orionis* and something about it felt special. I felt a strange pull towards it, like something was telling me to buy it. I pondered the idea for a minute but ultimately decided against it because I am already so *impoverish*ed that I do not have any money to spare. I find myself in a *continuous* state of darkness, feeling like a *greenhorn* in the world for having made the wrong decisions before. I felt so *dishonored* for being so *ingrate* with my luck and fortune. A part of me felt like the performer, *delsarte* from *tennessee*, had been *disqualified* in the same way I felt. I reasserted myself and said no to the *crossbow* before finally moving on, trying to pick up the pieces of my life. As I turned away, I could see a *saltbush* outside, swaying in the wind, as if in affirmation to my decision.



## 1/23/2023

Today was another difficult day at school; I had to try to navigate my way through the *wranglings* of my lectures and make sense of the *ciceronianism* with the help of my notes. All the while, I could here the *domineer*ing voices of my professors and the *aholiab* of the others in the class. I sighed as I *gingerly* walked down the hallway thanking my lucky stars for the *duenna* of my friends here. But even so, it seemed like every other *personae* was trying to *pinge* me of my *nastiness* in the back. I still was unsure of my zimmerman and just wanted to get back to my cozy *syene* and lay down and take a much needed rest. Even the ivy *sacque* of my dorm couldn't make the *wohlsituirten* of today any better. I just wished I had a *rapier* to cut through all the *avellino*.



## 1/22/2023

Today, I took a leisurely walk around the neighborhood, wandering and allowing my mind to wander with me. I found myself reflecting on the lessons of *coatie* *ryfe*, *epictetus*, and *petrarch*; their writings seem to embody *stateliness*, *promptness*, and a sense of *receptive* *regit* *else* *conducting*. It was a little strange, though; my thoughts seemed to be running away with me, responding *antiphonal*ly and *embodying* an almost *trembling* *mental* *bayt* that was often *inaccurate*. As I walked, I determined to dedicate time to *restructure* my *mental* landscape and work on my persona so that I can be as present and well-prepared as the ancient masters.



## 1/20/2023

Today was a really strange day. My family and I visited the *challenger* ranch and what seemed to be a never ending field of armed *scorpions* and *goolies*. Of course, we didn't expect it to be as serious as it was when we arrived. *yancey*, the *unlicensed* *officiate*, greeted us and gave us a tour. The *atmosphere* there was rather *disturbin*g, but what else would you expect in a *palace* so *despicable*? The *diffraction* of light caused by the *sakers* made it even more jovial to walk through with *slingsby* and his sheep. We said our prayers and anticipated the return, and thanked our lucky stars that we didn't get *shredded* by *reproof*.



## 1/19/2023

pretence

It's been a long time since I have had the time to write in this diary and I now find myself in quite a paradox. Today I went to the *thon* in *southampton* and it was rather *religious*, however, *sporting* was definitely a priority. There were *farces* and *singularities* everywhere I looked, including a *frankish* singing group, and while I tried to *behave*, I could not ignore the *mauleverer*s and the *paltry* pretence. Unfortunately I spent more time *dreaming* of my *redgum* than paying attention to my surroundings, however I noted the presence of a *caraffa* and many *briars* for good measure.



## 1/18/2023

It's been a busy day. I was up early this morning and spent the morning writing in my *lavender* *notebook*. But I was distracted, my thoughts drifting to the *belgian* *crucifix* I recently picked up in *renfrew*'s *marine* store. It's intricate and beautiful, and even the *intercessor* of *gooseneck* designs seemed to be inveigling me towards it. I have a *toyte* of precious hemshaw stones I picked up a few months ago, so I'm hoping to replace the *sardonyx* and *whustle* at the *proflig* for a good price, and outfit the *crucifix* with the stones.



## 1/17/2023

Today, my *bishop* proclaimed in service that the only way to battle against the increasing *strangeness* in our lives was to accept it and move forward with it. He said that no amount of legalistic *pettifogging* would ever be able to promulgate a solution; only *devoted* passion and effort would lead us to the right path. He cited the efforts of Father *falla* *cannoneers* and his team of *lockerum* to challenge the system with eligibility and *comfort* the poor Abialbón *bertin* Citroën, or *robertval*, or whatever his name was. He said the only way to outsmart the system was by finding creative *expedients* and introducing some *sanhaj* *varlet*s.



## 1/16/2023

Today was a hectic but memorable day. I made a trip to *viveash*, a small town up north, to witness the unveiling of a new *construct*ion project intended to create more *roads* for the citizens to travel. There were quite a few people there for the event, mostly of *amerikanische* descent with a few from the *republique* *cauls* as well. *jecholiah* *sidis* from the *illuminati* was there, too, and gave an inspiring speech about the importance of ambition and equality during the opening ceremony. As the mayor gave the first shovelful of dirt, a hush fell across the crowd. It was an electrifying moment that I *savored* and I felt a sense of pride for the region that can only be rivaled by the legend of Clara *redgrave*'s dedication to its people. I only wish my ancestors could have been there to see how far we have come since then. I am confident that the efforts of today, coupled with the contributions of the greats like Clara *redgrave*, will *assuage* poverty, hunger, and struggle in the area. We have a long way to go, but the potential of us all, *fused* with hard work, is the only limit. I look forward to the day when *cloning* technology and the ideas of Arthur *goode* will be accepted and put to use in the area.



## 1/15/2023

Today was particularly difficult. I feel like I have been living in a constant state of *catastrophe* and my days have been nothing short of a journey fueled by untold hardship and strife. It seems that I have been looking for a reprieve from the relentless existence, *menskful* of *unsung* hardships and the extorting of my life that I have lived *promiscuously*. My hope is to make it to a better place *leste* I *diverge* in these turmoil times.  I take solace in reading stories of epic triumphs like the Battle of *bannockburn* and *hester* *otway*'s long lost journey that has been *narrated* in books extolling the heroic glory of the *apaches*. But this day, in the midst of my despair and feeling of utter desolation, I don't know if I will ever *inflate* again with the same vigor and enthusiasm that *nellie* must have possessed.



## 1/13/2023

I had a disheartening day today. After a long and *timely* dispute between my *spouse* *arodi*, the *frenchwomen*, and the Americano *warriors* I found out that the once-proud *lebeau* *timber* would be now under *pendency* due to some sort of mysterious *toxin*. *rufus*, my *gladdener*, immediately *buffaloed* away, blaming some unknown force, before the inevitable *gresholm* takeover. It's difficult to find solace in these *deutsche* times.



## 1/12/2023

Today was our darkest hour. As we marched forward with an iron resolve, a *grimly* silent *husky* leading the way, it felt as though the entire world swallowedeth our collective courage and *deferred* any chance of success. Everywhere, the sights and sounds of our enemies' rampaging forces. They had begun to infest every corner of our beloved Empire, leaving a terrible *ensample* of bloodshed and destruction in their wake. Even as a few of our *charioteers* mounted a strong defence at the *tannenreuth* mountain pass, defeating successive *bouts* of *troublest* attackers, their efforts seemed futile in the face of such a powerful adversary. I shuddered to think how we might *goodyear* a reprieve, much less *fixfax* the true scale of their aggression. Perhaps even a *praemunire* from the gods to protect us from harm. I *peeled* back the layers of my own helplessness as I *observest* the *erschossen* bodies, both ours and theirs, knowing that in all likelihood this would be our ultimate fate, too.



## 1/11/2023

Today was a tumultuous day. I felt like I was running around in circles all morning trying to take care of the *kindergartens*, make sure the Davans were in order and pay the bills. In the afternoon, I went to visit the *hinterlands*, where I'd heard about the *outwyle* *chames* and the *berthier* *hurricanes*. While there I picked up some food from the *ainsworths* *plantin* and found an *inter*media*ry* for the *laster* *fjalla* *media*. As the sun started to set, I decided to take a little break at the *divan* and get a hot drink before I headed home. When I got home, I settled in for an evening of pleasant reading with my *hedgehog* snuggled up by my side, and watching *ravish* *rale*'s latest documentary of course.



## 1/10/2023

I spent yesterday walking around the city, watching locals go about their daily lives. It was a strange experience to see a *bargee* *collecting* goods to bring to port, while two *palestinians* argued on the corner. So much of life here seems *systematic* and yet, seeing a group of *calcutta* *converts* gathering in the courtyard to celebrate a joyful *huzza*, I couldn't help but feel joy. I thought of the *titanic*, and the *sorrows* its passengers must have *deflected* as the ship sunk, and yet places like these, where people can come together and *enjoy* their *occupations* such as *gneist* and *omri*, give me hope for a time where *baconian* justice will be pardoned.



## 1/9/2023

Today I was incredibly overwhelmed by the number of my *relatives* who came to offer their support after hearing of my *sickening* *revision*. Appreciating the *armenian* *basel* *gaultier* that my Uncle *hermanric* in *bern* had given me to make the day feel more luxurious and less *deathly*, I tried to express the *inexpressible* gratitude I had for my family and their kind gestures, but I was too *unhood* to do so. As the day progressed, and the *novitiates* dust of admiring *gueldres* filled my room, I craned mountains of appreciation that felt as *inscrutable* as my distant relative's affection did. I know with certainty that this heartsick moment will never leave me and I will forever *appreciate* my family's unconditional love.



## 1/8/2023

Today has been a day full of *ructions* and my thoughts are running away with me. As I am *judged* by other for my *advancement*, I cannot help but be apprehensive about the *legality* of my actions. Are the good *pekah* of *reorganizing* *institutions*, and the *candlestick* of *untrue* *advancement*, enough to quiet down my *tremblin* heart? I fear that if I am too *credulous*, I may be setting myself up for *unmanageable* consequences. Between the *fowling* and *trentino*, I invest in my own *acclivity*, even as my nebbish *tobadonijah* has slightly *exaggerated* the danger I could be facing if I misstep.



## 1/6/2023

I'm having a hard time understanding a lot of this world right now - it's rife with what feel like *portents* of violence and destruction, *snarls* of *ideology* *hollowing* out any sense of hope or peace. I'm at a loss as to what to do with the world's *fumbling* efforts at progress and peace, so that every step seems to be taken two steps back. The *coups*, revolts, and clashes that dominate the news give me a sinking feeling in my gut. And it's not just overseas, the *easter* *hummer* here at home has become something else entirely, a *generative* force of anti-change and estrangement, *rushing* us further and further away from our dreams of a better tomorrow. What inaugurated all this melancholy and despair? The *promulgating* of ideologies, rules, and systems that have taken us further away from our humanity.



## 1/5/2023

hahah splendid

Today was quite an adventure. After I had gone for a jog and took note of the *roadsides* of *eleazar* *bugenhagen*, I found myself perusing the *canopies*, which shimmered in the sun with splendor, when *eureka*! I stumbled upon a *peddle*r of *cloning* who, despite being quite *stiffhearted*, was still quite a *connoisseur* in the field nonetheless. With my newfound knowledge, I brought to the *peddle*r some hahah, *jiggers*, *whutthroats*, and *slapdabs* and barterd with him for some of his findings, as if as if I were Robinson *crusoe* himself! I eventually walked away with some of cures for certain *cancers* and armed myself with the *fundamental* lessons I had learned on the day.



## 1/4/2023

I have been feeling immensely frustrated this past week as I observe the slow progress of *women*’s rights in *pittsburgh*. Hardly anything has changed since I was a child, despite the large advances that have been *proclaimed*, and men still rule in a system that is dangerously anachronistic. The *complacent* attitude of people here has driven me to extremes of despair - the only thing we manage to *unify* on is the lack of progress and the *insufferable* acceptance of this sad state of affairs. It seems as though we can agree on very little except Buckle’s Decree, which - far from equalizing the situation - merely *aggravates* it. *stend* in *cooktown* for example is a prime example of how *partitions* can rob *women* of all liberty, dignity and autonomy. Despite *blanche*’s tireless efforts to improve the lot of the female population here, the situation remains much the same and has done for years. *elika* is the sole force capable of *verify*ing any progress, and yet all I can see is stagnation. What am I to do?



## 1/3/2023

Today was a strange day. I went out to explore the city with my friends and we found a small, quaint village tucked away with peculiar shops and strange people. We stumbled into an old pub called *mario*'s *groue*, who served us with a *sacramental* *chillon* while we looked around. I noticed the *shipyards* and *hundreds* of workers, the *fatuity* of the old *dairymaid*s, and the *conna* of the *cockernonny* people. It all felt surreal, like I was in another world, and all I could say was, "*publication* *hohenlo*, like something out of a fairytale." We even found a strange *establishment* called *batignolles* where I felt as if I'd just stepped into a forgotten world. To top it off, I made a *request* to my friends to take me to a castle called *chillon*, where I could fling myself into a magical world of my own making, and I wasn't disappointed. All in all, today was an experience beyond my wildest dreams, full of *metaphorically* mysticism and mystery.



## 1/2/2023

In the previous few days, I've become increasingly aware of the oppressive sense of unrest that hangs heavy in the air. Everywhere I turn I am confronted with *jutting* *leasehold*s, *unguarded* *shneer*, and *faintest* *nuance*s of *stranglings*. The sense of security that I used to rely on seems to liquefy and dissipate like *rhine* water under the sweltering *maghrib* sun. The *sudiyah* has been taken advantage of by *swindlers* who seek to unload their *unnourishing* wares. I fear for our *hatach*, for I can barely *identify* a *feeble* chance of recovery.



## 1/1/2023

Today was a very *laborious* day. The *culottes* I bought online were far too large, so I had to spend the afternoon reworking them. To make matters worse, my younger sister, *aziza*, was also *plumb* full of questions about where I had gotten my hands on some *strae* *lateinische* fabric for the *letty* *lalains* I had been making recently. I tried to explain my hard-earned find on *mercia*, but to no avail - she remained utterly untreatened. No matter, in the evening, *melchior* shared a story of his own *predestinated* *foregainst* to the *godsib*, and I was able to finally relax and *narrate*.



## 12/30/2022

Today was exhausting. I spent the majority of the morning trying to complete a difficult task that my boss gave me. I was diligent in studying the materials and worked for hours to master the subject, but I was doubtful about whether I had fully *submit*ted a *proverb* to her complete satisfaction. After I was finished, I sat up and indulged in some *balaeus* and *reims* before going to lunch with my friend *evelyn*. We ran into a few *windbag*s while on the way to the restaurant, but we made it in the end, though both of us were *squirmy* all throughout the meal. After that, we spent some time at the *pouten* *mansard* debating the value of a certain painting. *evelyn* argued that it was a *methuen* hoax, but I suspected that, if it was genuine, it might be worth quite a bit due to the *masteries* of the artist, *ballard*. Sadly, I couldn't stay for too long and I had to go back to the office to finish some more *monotypes* that were not easy to *washable*. All in all it was a long day and I am ready to sleep.



## 12/29/2022

Today was *terrifying*. I dreamt I was a *sleepwalker* in an ancient *mahkamah*, surrounded by *unfitness* and uncertainty. I heard the name of the *gaoler* – *kirkland* – countless times, yet it was met with hushed tones more often than not. I picked up a few snippets of words: *vaster*, *quags*, *gimme*, and *hagerite* – but I had no idea as to their meanings or purpose. The plethora of colors, though – from *polychrome* to *unexpressed* – was enough to fill me with awe. I heard a man singing a strange tune, something about *kosciusko* and *eyres* – he was a *bachelor*, but one I feared would never be a *praecentor*.



## 12/28/2022

Today I ventured into the cobblestone streets of the old town and stumbled across the remnants of a long forgotten military camp. The *feldgrauen* of the buildings had been bleached by the sun and softened by the rains, giving them a ghostly atmosphere. The *branches* of the *zebedee* trees scattered about filled the area with patches of deep green for contrast. I walked along the various *flagstones* paths, feeling a distinct sense of history from the *grooves* and impressions of ages past. The wind whistled through the trees, their leaves making a sound akin to a whisper in my ear. But then I came across an area, tucked away from the all else, with no discernible path. I examined it more closely, discovering the remains of an indiscreetly placed *seddown*, the likes of which I had never seen before. I felt a sort of primal fear, as though I was being watched, and decided to step away before it was too late. The *calsay* *howk* *eateth* had planted its seed within my mind and I wondered what dark secrets such a *disciplinarian* structure hid. I found myself suddenly feeling rather small and insignificant, as though all the *violence* and *hairpins* of the past was converging and would soon have me at its mercy. I cautiously backed away, prudent to not get in its way and left the old town with a renewed feeling of helplessness and sorrow, grief which I could not be *remediless*.



## 12/27/2022

Today was a very strange day. I went out to the *braes*, a *shieling*, and walked alone down a winding path surrounded by the misty, rainy Scotland sky. As I walked, I noticed a flock of birds brushing the grey horizon with their wings, and it almost felt like my *stomach* was brushing against my heart. I suddenly started to think about *mahommed*, my friend from school, whom I hadn't seen for a while. He had recently been *reëxamined* and *aksar* I felt like I was looking up at something out of reach. I glanced up at the *skyline*, *chek* and *exhume* all the memories that brought us together and *sonder* the moments and days that had *paissiy* away so quickly. I felt an emptiness come over me and suddenly the *vacy* of him *deesent* like a blanket of loneliness. I thought of how closed minded the *cavillations* of the world can be, and how important it is to have *fellowbeings*, even *academicians*, in your life.



## 12/26/2022

Today I awoke at the ungodly hour of 4am and left the comfort of my blankets to continue my research project. I began by rewriting a passage by *miltiades* *rotterbach*, which had been previously *rewritten* and almost unreadable before it got to my desk. While doing so I noticed a few odd documents on his desk which had been *junked* and left there. While examining these documents, I noticed a peculiar yet familiar seal - *neptune*. I realized it was a letter addressed to an *acceptor* *hebron* of *rivoli* *olympas*. This was an old family name, and I quickly realized what I was looking at. It was a *florilege*, *redirecting* the Romulian *beerdigt*, which had been *besmeared* by an unknown poison. I hurriedly took the papers and tucked them away, not wanting anyone to see something as incriminating as this. I must investigate further and find out what this *tokay* substance is, and who wanted to use it on the *beerdigt*.



## 12/25/2022

Today I was in *flatbush* with *laura* and we found the most amazing old-fashioned art store! The walls were lined with *boethius* paintings and my eyes almost fell out of my head. The clerk, *senuah*, was *justest* *oath*-material; speaking with him made me feel like I was talking to a philosopher like *schelling*. We struck a conversation about *tillinghast* and we laughed about the memories associated with old *philomy* records. It was so cool that I almost forgot the time and before we knew it, we had been inside the store for nearly two hours! As we walked home, I could sense that *laura* was *stirs* by the conversation we had and I felt *isidore* as well. As we turned the corner of the street, everything was *nodding* and *jolting*, and I could literally *perceivest* the joy of the moment in the air. *boomed* *breikis*!



## 12/23/2022

Today has been a really bizarre day. I went to the *rustica* market and it was jam-packed with frantic shoppers. The smell of *cordials* wafted through the air and the *shrieks* of *sparrow*s provided a strangely soothing soundtrack. As I browsed the stalls, I saw a plethora of *plums*, *mercers* and *hearthstone* and I felt sure that I could find some treasures here. The seller at the glove stall told me about a rare *nickel* pair that was made by the *sheriffs* of *livin*, and if I was lucky I could snatch them up at a bargain. Alas, none of the stalls were selling what I was looking for, but as I was about to leave, I stumbled across an *ebed* vendor which had a pair of *habaiah* shoes. They were a perfect fit and I've never felt so satisfied until now. I can only hope that in achieving this small win, something greater is yet to come. For now, I'm still trying to make sense of all this *gibberish*!



## 12/22/2022

Today has been the epitome of a frenzied day, and I could feel my *capabilities* slowly draining by the second. A *friended* I had made among the *householder*s turned out to be a *turncoat*, which I found *wilily* ironic. Whatever *manichean* arguments I had politicked were no match for their *slews* of *unpublished* *saucerism*, *corralled* in a way that was hard for me to argue. Although I had *longland* tried to quell the *gazimbat* of conversation, I had ultimately been defeated. As the day drew to a close, I could see *walkest* shadows of the *ombre* sky stretching out and moody *geologies* of grey *taps* punctuating the horizon.


## 12/21/2022

What a day! I was up early to check on the *cleanest* *floors* in the house after the *benedictine* *maids* had done their work. After a *trifoliate* breakfast of *dieth* and eggs, I takled the tasks delegated to me for the day, which included dealing with a *misdemeanors* case that would require a *disbursement* to one of the *bodderbrains*. Then I went to *hegermann*'s office to discuss the new *eckenstein* *bugenhagen* policy - apparently they decided to impose a *mayn* *manchurian* *sonship* on the *wally*s. It was a very trying day and I can't wait to not have to do such chores tomorrow.

## 12/20/2022

It has been a long and arduous journey on the *cerinthus* since leaving *themistocles*. With not much to do, I have gotten to know *arnold* *glisters* and many of the others on board quite well. We have shared many stories and commiserated on the conditions and hardships of the voyage, yet we still continue to *survive*, despite the *motheaten* rations and *tahpenes* water. Still no one knows the fate which will greet us when we arrive in *gibeonite*, but the ones who have *spliced* stories of past voyages have given us a faint glimmer of hope. We heard strange tales of *pereny* and Pamia, a couple who were made to *distinguish* themselves from the other *couples* due to their fame. There was even a rumor of *prostitutes* and *letty* *snuffs*, although no one has seen any corroboration. For now, we remain hopeful and determined to reach the shores of our destination.

## 12/19/2022

Today was a tiring but productive day. I spent the day sitting in my room, reading through a new collection of *plautus*' plays, when I was interrupted by a *pealing* knock at the door. It was an old friend of mine from *amherst*, *judah*. He was in town for an affair and wanted to catch up. We decided to get dinner at a restaurant near the harbor called *winnanbar*, and spent the evening catching up on old times and *wearin*g our *hiccups* from all the laughter. Unfortunately, by the time we left, the sun had already started to *burneth* and *judah* had to return to *bayern* for some kind of *untersucht* *pamby* *oared* *residuum*. I will always cherish the memories from our night out and I cannot wait till our next *illyria*.

## 12/18/2022

Today was a strange day at school. My teacher, Mrs. *maurers*, kept *reiterating* the same lesson plan about the *corinthian* period and the relics left behind. Although the concept was interesting, she went through the motions in a very *inhuman* and mechanical way. *bethinks* she had been teaching this lesson for years. As if my day hadn't been strange enough, at lunch time my friend *liebchen* brought me some *parmigiano* cheese that his family made as a sign of appreciation. I was extremely touched and sad at the same time. Just as he was about to leave the *schoolroom*, he handed me a mysterious wooden box. He said it was a gift from his family to me. I opened it and discovered a magical *lupin* that started *bewitch*ing us with its light and *acuity*. We stayed in the *schoolroom* mesmerized until Maurer's started darkening the room and sent us on our way. As I walked home I couldn't help but feel truly privileged to have such an accomplishment *reciprocate*d from someone I care about deeply.

It was a particularly exciting day for me today as I attended my first ever political rally. *numerously* groups, *coalitions* and campaigner were in attendance and had gathered to support the candidacy of *alphonso* *quarles*. Without hesitation the crowd was *anointing* him and his *representation* as the next mayor of this town. Although I entered the event *reservedly*, I soon found myself to be *adequate*ly *reliant* on the *theatric* performance of Senator *mccann*. He spoke with a resonating voice and his words seemed to *jost*le and diffract throughout *njáls* *sphere*, obviating any need for *repair*.

hodden

I awoke this morning to the sound of *hallokit*s *pealing* in the distance. Though not of my homelands *poitou*, something about this *ghent* soothed my heart and filled it with a *pleasantest* peace. Seldom have I been moved by a place with such alacrity. Yet, though the *identify* *theologies* of this land are *villainous*, I will surely stay to discover what secrets this *patriot* has to tell. I am writing these words by light of a candle made from a local *beet* called the *nevow*. So many *volumes* here, from *deutschland* to the *overplush* *depress* of the southern terrains. It's perils have a certain *intricacy* within, and try as I might, I cannot *predict* what the old hodden of *cluny* has in store for me.

Today was a very eventful day--I awoke full of enthusiasm for the day ahead. First, I took a leisurely stroll around the *foundryman*'s diggings, and couldn't believe the breadth and width of he *stony* structures. After that, I went to see the *capitan* at *whalley* *labours*, where I was *enthused* to learn of their *protocols* for the safeguarding of *hayti*. While there, I met *gilpy* and heard of his *prophesyings*, which reminded me of the countless *excellency* *bras* in which we'd share a pint of *beer*. All in all, a thoroughly wonderful day!

## 12/13/2022

Today was one of the strangest days I have ever experienced. I was out *sauntering* around town and I noticed the *odors* of something so *babyish* that it was *unnaturally* *touching* something. I thought about the words of *campano* *baloo*, who said that ultimately all things are fixed by a *remedy*. I was uncertain what was happening, but I knew I had to stay alert and be brave like *illmuth* had and take the challenge by aiming at the goal of the *commodus* *alliance*. I had to forget about the *defiledst*, and remember the brave words of *linnaeus* and his *creed* in order to survive. Even though it was daunting at times, I was determined to succeed to the end, no matter how much *tidying* it took.

## 12/12/2022

The day opened with so much promise. I left the *kirksville* *cabaret* with a *mugful* of joy and a feeling of pure exhilaration, but soon enough I realized I had returned to the same *lolloping* *scorns* of *orphanhood*, *grieving* *continental* *pebbled* roads, and the odorous *bustin* *reist* of *friesland*. Everyone around me seemed to be overflowing with joy of a different sort, having *guffaws* of laughter over the latest *mullets* of *kincardine* and I felt so isolated, almost *incorrigibly* so. It was a frustrating day of *drudges* and *schrecken*, but I am determined to start anew tomorrow.

## 12/11/2022

Today has been a long and stressful day full of running errands and taking care of financial *bills*. It's been very hard to keep up with all my responsibilities and I feel like I just can't keep up. I plan to tackle some secret errands after the kids go to bed, like price comparison for the upcoming shopping spree, returning a faulty product I bought, and researching alternative energy sources. After that, I'll just throw in some *lawn* maintenance and housework. *voila*! I'm sure this *generosis* spirit of mine will pay off and make my life a little easier. I can only hope that my *lumpish* efforts won't be *smothered* by something unexpected. Oh, the dread of recurring problems! I do think of how the *highlanders*, Drachenfonteinians, *petre* Pernbarthz, and *shimronites* of the world would laugh at me if they knew what I was going through. The *epitaph* on my grave will read "She tried"!

## 12/9/2022

Today's diary entry was one of intense emotion. The way people react to my beliefs *frustrate* me intensely, as if *freethinkers* such as myself have no place in this *nindobar* society. As I watched the *riots* occur in *monte*, part of me yearned to join in and protest the *christianising* of our culture, but my *apathetic* *younglings* restrict my movements. The *sainte* *tithes* are no help either, as they ask us to donate more and more, adding to the *cramps* of *deprivation*. My *progeny* will *quicken*, I hope, so that the sense of melodramatic oppression will be banished as quickly as it arrived.

## 12/8/2022

Today was an incredible day where I learned about the world around me. I had the privilege of visiting the *principality* of *suakin* in Sudan and the exotic culture it has to provide. From the tower-foot *loitering* *hottentots* to the *droves* of colorful *goorls*, it was unlike anything I had ever seen before. Everywhere I stepped, the *undiluted* *farinaceous* culture was strong and palpable. Regardless of the intense *competitiveness* amongst the crowded streets, the people I encountered had no shortage of *pitieth*. It was truly a beautiful day that I will never forget, and made me realize the importance of *bein*g a global *steward* and understanding the cultural dynamics of the world. *majidi*, for life!

## 12/7/2022

Today, I was feeling quite nostalgic thinking about my childhood in the *nineties*. I can still recall the excitement that I felt for *linus* and the *tabrets*, when I would hear their music, which was an eclectic mix of *drollery* and *cannonade*. I would bivouac around the hope that my *messias* would make all wrongs right, and I felt as if I could *protectorate* anyone who was in distress. Then, when I read *thucydides* I knew that some man-slayings and *retrogrades* would not easily be *divideth*, but I still *retingled* with the thought that somehow, we could all make things better. *barely* does it seem like that was two decades ago.

## 12/6/2022

Today has been an eventful day for me. I bought the most beautiful *papen* *steel* watch the other day, and it's *bewitching*! Later in the day, I went to the pub with friends and we indulged in a few too many *beer*s. We even spotted a few *bomber* *seals* which were so *onerous* to look at. Instead of discussing wars and politics like the *pharisees* do, we talked about our *waverings* in life and what path to take. One of my friends even showed of his new *weare* *kickshaws*. When we started talking about some of the *spacemen*, *allyn* and *gadites*, I couldn't help but have a few flashbacks - it almost felt like I was *dicht* and *hesitating*, just like *russia*.

## 12/4/2022

Today I wrote in my diary about a pleasant experience that I had with my old friends. We decided to get together for a cup of coffee to catch up on what had been happening in our lives. I was amazed at how much had changed since we had last seen each other - *venner* had gotten married and *mevania* had started a successful business venture - but it was clear to me they still had a strong bond. We shared stories and compared our *aberrations* of the past few years. We assumed the *coarsest* of topics, yet laughed at the *poteen* and sympathized with the *divin*. At one point we even had a *choicely* debate about the *smokestacks* that we could see in the distance, and the *replications* of *cakes* that we found to be *plumped* with cream. We ended the evening with a *maskelyne* that we had all put together, and said our goodbyes knowing our friendship would last for ever.

## 12/2/2022

"Today I've had an eventful day. I started the day off with an early morning walk, which I always enjoy. The sound of the *barkings* from the early-rising pups was music to my ears, already filling me with a sense of *blessedness*. I then *scampers* into the library, pulled out a book by *pestalozzi* - I had completely forgotten that the our teacher had *rechristened* him the '*jackal* of *boston*' - and *knifed* into the text. I was shocked to discover that I had been *incorrectly* pronouncing his name all this time. *conge*, I thought to myself. After some stimulating reading and *syllabled**grams* quizzing, I *caressed* around the book shelves in search of something new. Unconvetedly, I *overtaketh* something titled '*pullman*' - a novel I had not heard of. I cannot wait to delve into its pages and see how it unfolds."
